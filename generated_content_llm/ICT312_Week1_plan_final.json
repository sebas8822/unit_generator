                  "content": "Digital Forensics and Other Related Disciplines\n\nAccording to DIBS USA, Inc., a privately owned corporation specializing in digital forensics since the 1990s (www.dibsforensics.com), digital forensics involves scientifically examining and analyzing data from computer storage media so that it can be used as evidence in court. In the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) document “Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response” (http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-86.pdf, 2006), digital forensics is defined as “the application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data.” Typically, investigating digital devices includes collecting data\n\nchain of custody for the data.” Typically, investigating digital devices includes collecting data securely, examining suspect data to determine details such as origin and content, presenting digital information to courts, and applying laws to digital device practices.\n\nIn general, digital forensics is used to investigate data that can be retrieved from a computer’s hard drive or other storage media. Like an archaeologist excavating a site, digital forensics examiners retrieve information from a computer or its components. The information retrieved might already be on the drive, but it might not be easy to find or decipher. On the other hand, network forensics yields information about how attackers gain access to a network along with files they might have copied, examined, or tampered with. Network forensics examiners use log files to determine when users logged on and determine which URLs users accessed, how they logged on to the network, and from what location. Network forensics also tries to determine what tracks or new files were left behind on a\n\nlocation. Network forensics also tries to determine what tracks or new files were left behind on a victim’s computer and what changes were made. In Chapter 10, you explore when and how network forensics should be used in an investigation.\n\nDigital forensics is also different from data recovery Retrieving files that were deleted accidentally or purposefully. , which involves retrieving information that was deleted by mistake or lost during a power surge or server crash, for example. In data recovery, typically you know what you’re looking for. Digital forensics is the task of recovering data that users have hidden or deleted, with the goal of ensuring that the recovered data is valid so that it can be used as evidence. In this regard, digital forensics differs from other types of evidence recovered from a scene.

The evidence can be inculpatory evidence Evidence that indicates a suspect is guilty of the crime he or she is charged with. (in criminal cases, the expression is “incriminating”) or exculpatory evidence Evidence that indicates the suspect is innocent of the crime. , meaning it tends to clear the suspect. Examiners often approach a digital device not knowing whether it contains evidence. They must search storage media and piece together any data they find. Forensics software tools can be used for most cases. In extreme cases, examiners can use electron microscopes and other sophisticated equipment to retrieve information from machines that have been damaged or reformatted\n\nsophisticated equipment to retrieve information from machines that have been damaged or reformatted purposefully. This method is usually cost prohibitive, so it’s not normally used.\n\nForensics investigators often work as part of a team to secure an organization’s computers and networks. The digital investigation function can be viewed as part of a triad that makes up computing security. Rapid progress in technology has resulted in an expansion of the skills needed and varies depending on the organization using practitioners in this field. Figure 1-1 shows the investigations triad made up of these functions:\n\nVulnerability/threat assessment and risk management\n\nNetwork intrusion detection and incident response\n\nDigital investigations\n\nEach side of the triad in Figure 1-1 represents a group or department responsible for performing the associated tasks. Although each function operates independently, all three groups draw from one another when a large-scale digital investigation is being conducted. By combining these three groups into a team, all aspects of a digital technology investigation can be addressed without calling in outside specialists. In smaller companies, one group might perform all the tasks shown in the investigations triad, or a small company might contract with service providers to perform these tasks.\n\nWhen you work in the vulnerability/threat assessment and risk management The group that determines the weakest points in a system. It covers physical security and the security of OSs and applications. group, you test and verify the integrity of stand-alone workstations and network servers. This integrity check covers the physical security of systems and the security of operating systems (OSs) and applications. People working in this group (often known as penetration testers) test for vulnerabilities of OSs and applications used in the network and conduct authorized attacks on the network to assess vulnerabilities. Typically, people performing this task have several years of experience in system administration. Their job is to poke holes in the network to help an organization be better\n\nsystem administration. Their job is to poke holes in the network to help an organization be better prepared for a real attack.\n\nProfessionals in the vulnerability assessment and risk management group also need skills in network intrusion detection and incident response Detecting attacks from intruders by using automated tools; also includes the manual process of monitoring network firewall logs. . This group detects intruder attacks by using automated tools and monitoring network firewall logs. When an external attack is detected, the response team tracks, locates, and identifies the intrusion method and denies further access to the network. If an intruder launches an attack that causes damage or potential damage, this team collects the necessary evidence, which can be used for civil or criminal litigation against the intruder and to prevent future intrusions. If an internal user is engaged in illegal acts or\n\nthe intruder and to prevent future intrusions. If an internal user is engaged in illegal acts or policy violations, the network intrusion detection and incident response group might assist in locating the user. For example, someone at a community college sends e-mails containing a worm to other users on the network. The network team realizes the e-mails are coming from a node on the internal network, and the security team focuses on that node.

                  "content": "A Brief History of Digital Forensics\n\nFifty years ago, few people imagined that computers would be an integral part of everyday life. Now computer technology is commonplace, as are crimes in which a digital device is the instrument of the crime, the target of the crime, and, by its nature, the location where evidence is stored.\n\nBy the 1970s, electronic crimes were increasing, especially in the financial sector. Most computers in that era were mainframes, used by trained people with specialized skills who worked in finance, engineering, and academia. White-collar fraud began when people in these industries saw a way to make money by manipulating computer data. One of the most well-known crimes of the mainframe era is the one-half cent crime. Banks commonly tracked money in accounts to the third decimal place or more. They used and still use the rounding-up accounting method when paying interest. If the interest applied to an account resulted in a fraction of a cent, that fraction was used in the calculation for the next account until the total resulted in a whole cent. It was assumed that eventually every customer\n\naccount until the total resulted in a whole cent. It was assumed that eventually every customer would benefit from this averaging. Some computer programmers corrupted this method by opening an account for themselves and writing programs that diverted all the fractional monies into their accounts. In small banks, this practice amounted to only a few hundred dollars a month. In large banks with millions of accounts, however, the amount could reach hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nDuring this time, most law enforcement officers didn’t know enough about computers to ask the right questions or to preserve evidence for trial. Many began to attend Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) programs designed to train law enforcement in handling digital data.\n\nAs PCs gained popularity and began to replace mainframe computers in the 1980s, many different OSs emerged. Apple released the Apple IIe in 1983 and then the Macintosh in 1984. Computers such as the TRS-80 and Commodore 64 were the machines of the day. CP/M machines, such as the Kaypro and Zenith, were also in demand.\n\nDisk Operating System (DOS) was available in many varieties, including PC-DOS, QDOS, DR-DOS, IBM-DOS, and MS-DOS. Forensics tools at that time were simple, and most were generated by government agencies, such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP, which had its own investigative tools) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Most tools were written in C and assembly language and weren’t available to the general public.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, a new tool, Xtree Gold, appeared on the market. It recognized file types and retrieved lost or deleted files. Norton DiskEdit soon followed and became the preferred tool for finding and recovering deleted files. You could use these tools on the most powerful PCs of that time; IBM-compatible computers had hard disks of 10 to 40 MB and two floppy drives, as shown in Figure 1-2.\n\nIn 1987, Apple produced the Mac SE, a Macintosh with an external EasyDrive hard disk with 60 MB of storage (see Figure 1-3). At this time, the popular Commodore 64 still used standard audiotapes to record data, so the Mac SE represented an important advance in computer technology.\n\nBy the early 1990s, specialized tools for digital forensics were available. The International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS) An organization created to provide training and software for law enforcement in the digital forensics field. introduced training on software for digital forensics examinations, and the IRS created search-warrant programs. However, no commercial GUI software for digital forensics was available until ASR Data created Expert Witness for Macintosh. This software could recover deleted files and fragments of deleted files. One of the ASR Data partners later left and developed EnCase, which became a popular digital forensics tool.\n\nAs computer technology continued to evolve, more digital forensics software was developed. The introduction of large hard disks posed new problems for investigators. Most DOS-based software didn’t recognize a hard disk larger than 8 GB. Because contemporary computers have hard disks of 500 GB and often much larger, changes in forensics software were needed. Later in this book, you explore the challenges of examining older software and hardware.\n\nOther tools, such as ILook, which is currently maintained by the IRS Criminal Investigation Division and limited to law enforcement, can analyze and read special files that are copies of a disk. AccessData Forensic Toolkit (FTK) has become a popular commercial product that performs similar tasks in the law enforcement and civilian markets.\n\nAs software companies become savvier about digital forensics and investigations, they are producing more forensics tools to keep pace with technology. This book describes several tools but by no means all available tools. You should refer to trade publications, e-zines, and Web sites to stay current.",

Therefore, when statutes or regulations don’t exist, case law is used. In common law nations, such as the United States, case law allows legal counsel to apply previous similar cases to current ones in an effort to address ambiguity in laws. Examiners must be familiar with recent court rulings on search and seizure in the electronic environment to avoid mistakes such as exceeding a search warrant’s authority. Recent events involving privacy incursions by government agencies have resulted in new laws and policies. Developments in technology have changed how everyday events are viewed. For example, what should be considered private conversations? Which devices are actually protected?\n\nAlthough law enforcement can certainly confiscate anything an arrested person is carrying and log that a device, such as a smartphone, was on the person, they don’t necessarily have the right or authority to search the device. These actions are being challenged in courts constantly. Remaining vigilant in keeping up with changing case law is critical to being an effective digital forensics investigator.",

The suspect installed video cameras throughout his house, served alcohol to young women to intoxicate them, and secretly filmed them playing strip poker. When he was accused of molesting a child, police seized his computers and other physical evidence. The investigator discovered that the computers used CoCo DOS, an OS that had been out of use for years.

For example, a recent murder case involved a husband and wife who owned a Macintosh store. When the wife was discovered dead, apparently murdered, investigators found that she had wanted to leave her husband but didn’t because of her religious beliefs. The police got a search warrant and confiscated the home and office computers. When the detective on the case examined the home system, he found that the hard drive had been compressed and erased.

              "content": "An Overview of Digital Forensics\n\nAs the world has become more of a level playing field, with more people online who have access to the same information (Thomas L. Freidman, The World Is Flat, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2005), the need to standardize digital forensics processes has become more urgent. The definition of digital forensics Applying investigative procedures for a legal purpose; involves the analysis of digital evidence as well as obtaining search warrants, maintaining a chain of custody, validating with mathematical hash functions, using validated tools, ensuring repeatability, reporting, and presenting evidence as an expert witness. has also evolved over the years from simply involving securing and analyzing digital information stored on a computer for use as evidence in civil, criminal, or administrative\n\ndigital information stored on a computer for use as evidence in civil, criminal, or administrative cases. The former director of the Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory, Ken Zatyko, wrote a treatise on the many specialties including computer forensics, network forensics, video forensics, and a host of others. He defined it as “[t]he application of computer science and investigative procedures for a legal purpose involving the analysis of digital evidence (information of probative value that is stored or transmitted in binary form) after proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics (hash function), use of validated tools, repeatability, reporting and possible expert presentation” (“Commentary: Defining Digital Forensics,” Forensic Magazine, 2007).\n\nThe field of digital forensics can also encompass items such as research and incident response. With incident response, most organizations are concerned with protecting their assets and containing the situation, not necessarily prosecuting or finding the person responsible. Research in digital forensics also isn’t concerned with prosecution or validity of evidence. This book is intended for digital forensics investigators and examiners at the civil, criminal, and administrative levels. Other facets of digital forensics are beyond the scope of this book. Keep in mind that depending on the jurisdiction and situation, forensic investigators and examiners might be the same or different personnel. In this book, the terms are used interchangeably.\n\nNote\n\nFor a more in-depth discussion of what the term “digital forensics” means, see “Digital Forensic Evidence Examination” (Fred Cohen, www.fredcohen.net/Books/2013-DFE-Examination.pdf, 2012).\n\nMany groups have tried to create digital forensics certifications that could be recognized worldwide but have failed in this attempt. However, they have created certifications for specific categories of practitioners, such as government investigators. With the ubiquitous access to mobile devices now, digital evidence is everywhere, so the need for a global standardized method is even more critical so that companies and governments can share and use digital evidence. In October 2012, an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for digital forensics was ratified. This standard, ISO 27037 “Information technology – Security techniques – Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence” (see www.iso.org/standard/44381.html),\n\nacquisition and preservation of digital evidence” (see www.iso.org/standard/44381.html), defines the personnel and methods for acquiring and preserving digital evidence. To address the multinational cases that continue to emerge, agencies in every country should develop policies and procedures that meet this standard.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), signed into law in 1973, was created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings, but many states’ rules map to the FRE, too. In another attempt to standardize procedures, the FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) was formed in 1984 to handle the increase in cases involving digital evidence. By the late 1990s, CART had teamed up with the Department of Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL) for research and training. Much of the early curriculum in this field came from the DCFL. For more information on the FBI’s cybercrime investigation services, see www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber.\n\nFiles maintained on a computer are covered by different rules, depending on the nature of the documents. Many court cases in state and federal courts have developed and clarified how the rules apply to digital evidence. The Fourth Amendment The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in the Bill of Rights dictates that the government and its agents must have probable cause for search and seizure. to the U.S. Constitution (and each state’s constitution) protects everyone’s right to be secure in their person, residence, and property from search and seizure. Continuing development of the jurisprudence of this amendment has played a role in determining whether the search for digital evidence has established a different precedent, so separate search warrants Legal documents that allow law\n\nhas established a different precedent, so separate search warrants Legal documents that allow law enforcement to search an office, a home, or other locale for evidence related to an alleged crime. might not be necessary. However, when preparing to search for evidence in a criminal case, many investigators still include the suspect’s computer and its components in the search warrant to avoid later admissibility problems.\n\nIn an important case involving these issues, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court addressed expectations of privacy and whether evidence is admissible (see Commonwealth v. Copenhefer, 587 A.2d 1353, 526 Pa. 555 [1991]). Initial investigations by the FBI, state police, and local police resulted in discovering computer-generated notes and instructions—some of which had been deleted—that had been concealed in hiding places around Corry, Pennsylvania. The investigation also produced several possible suspects, including David Copenhefer, who owned a nearby bookstore and apparently had bad relationships with the victim and her husband. Examination of trash discarded from Copenhefer’s store revealed drafts of the ransom note and directions. Subsequent search warrants resulted in seizure of evidence\n\nof the ransom note and directions. Subsequent search warrants resulted in seizure of evidence against him. Copenhefer’s computer contained several drafts and amendments of the text of phone calls to the victim and the victim’s husband the next day, the ransom note, the series of hidden notes, and a plan for the entire kidnapping scheme (Copenhefer, p. 559).\n\nOn direct appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the physical evidence, including the digital forensics evidence, was sufficient to support the bookstore owner’s conviction. Copenhefer’s argument was that “[E]ven though his computer was validly seized pursuant to a warrant, his attempted deletion of the documents in question created an expectation of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment. Thus, he claims, under Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), and its progeny, Agent Johnson’s retrieval of the documents, without first obtaining another search warrant, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and the documents thus seized should have been suppressed” (Copenhefer, p. 561).\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating, “A defendant’s attempt to secrete evidence of a crime is not synonymous with a legally cognizable expectation of privacy. A mere hope for secrecy is not a legally protected expectation. If it were, search warrants would be required in a vast number of cases where warrants are clearly not necessary” (Copenhefer, p. 562).\n\nEvery U.S. jurisdiction has case law related to the admissibility of evidence recovered from computers and other digital devices. As you learn in this book, however, the laws on digital evidence vary between states as well as between provinces and countries.\n\nNote\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice offers a useful guide to search and seizure procedures for computers and computer evidence at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aabb/8b0caf982a0aa211f932252af38d4c9376fb.pdf.",

As a professional, you must exhibit the highest level of professional behavior at all times. To do so, you must maintain objectivity and confidentiality during an investigation, expand your technical knowledge constantly, and conduct yourself with integrity. Maintaining objectivity means you form opinions based on your education, training, experience, and the evidence in your cases. Avoid making conclusions about your findings until you have exhausted all reasonable leads and considered\n\nmaking conclusions about your findings until you have exhausted all reasonable leads and considered the available facts. Your ultimate responsibility is to find relevant digital evidence. You must avoid prejudice or bias to maintain the integrity of your fact-finding in all investigations. For example, if you’re employed by an attorney, don’t allow the attorney’s agenda to dictate the outcome of your investigation. Your reputation depends on maintaining your objectivity.\n\nYou must also maintain an investigation’s credibility by maintaining confidentiality. Discuss the case only with people who need to know about it, such as other investigators involved in the case or someone in the line of authority. If you need advice from other professionals, discuss only the general terms and facts about the case without mentioning specifics. All investigations you conduct must be kept confidential, until you’re designated as a witness or required by the attorney or court to release a report.\n\nIn the private-sector environment, confidentiality is critical, especially when dealing with employees who have been terminated. The agreement between the company and the employee might have been to represent the termination as a layoff or resignation in exchange for no bad references. If you give case details and the employee’s name to others, your company could be liable for breach of contract.\n\nIn some instances, a civil case might become a criminal case, and it could be years before the case finally goes to trial or is settled. If an investigator talks about evidence with unauthorized people, the case could be damaged. When working for an attorney on an investigation, the attorney-work-product rule applies to all communications. This means you can discuss the case only with the attorney or other members of the team working with the attorney. All communication about the case to other people requires the attorney’s approval.\n\nIn addition to maintaining objectivity and confidentiality, you can enhance your professional conduct by continuing your training. The field of digital investigations and forensics is changing constantly. You should stay current with the latest technical changes in computer hardware and software, networking, and forensic tools. You should also learn about the latest investigation techniques you can use in your cases. To continue your professional training, you should attend workshops, conferences, and vendor courses. You might also need to continue or enhance your formal education, such as pursuing certifications.

If you don’t have an advanced degree, consider graduate-level studies in a complementary area of study, such as business law or e-commerce. Several colleges and universities now offer associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees and certificate programs in digital forensics. Many companies are willing to assist with employee education expenses because it’s to their advantage that employees remain current in their knowledge.\n\nIn addition to education and training, membership in professional organizations adds to your credentials. These organizations often sponsor training and publications on the latest technical improvements and trends in digital forensic examinations. Also, keep up to date with the most current publications on digital forensics examination tools and techniques.\n\nAs a digital investigator and forensics professional, you’re expected to maintain honesty and integrity.

These devices can contain information that helps law enforcement officers determine the chain of events leading to a crime or information providing evidence that’s more likely to lead to a conviction. As an example of a case in which computers were involved in a crime, the police raided a suspected drug dealer’s home and found a desktop computer, several USB drives (also called “flash drives” or “thumb drives”), a tablet computer, and a cell phone in a bedroom (see Figure 1-8). The computer was “bagged and tagged,” meaning it was placed in evidence bags along with the storage media and then labeled with tags as part of the search and\n\nin evidence bags along with the storage media and then labeled with tags as part of the search and seizure.\n\nThe lead detective on the case wants you to examine the computer and cell phone to find and organize data that could be evidence of a crime, such as files containing names of the drug dealer’s contacts, text messages, and photos. The acquisitions officer gives you documentation of items the investigating officers collected with the computer, including a list of other storage media, such as removable disks and flash drives. The acquisitions officer also notes that the computer is a Windows 8 system, and the machine was running when it was discovered. Before shutting down the computer, the acquisitions officer photographs all open windows on the Windows desktop, including one showing File Explorer, and gives you the photos. (Before shutting down the computer, a live acquisition should be\n\nand gives you the photos. (Before shutting down the computer, a live acquisition should be done to capture RAM, too. This procedure is discussed in Chapter 10.)\n\nAs a digital forensics investigator, you’re grateful the officers followed proper procedure when acquiring the evidence. With digital evidence, it’s important to realize how easily key data, such as the last access date, can be altered by an overeager investigator who’s first on the scene. The U.S. DOJ has a document you can download that reviews the correct acquisition of electronic evidence, “Prosecuting Computer Crimes” (www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ssmanual2009.pdf, 2009). If this link has changed because of site updates, use the search feature.\n\nIn your preliminary assessment, you assume that the hard disk and storage media include intact files, such as e-mail messages, deleted files, and hidden files. A range of software is available for use in your investigation; your office uses the tool Autopsy from Sleuth Kit.\n\nNote\n\nThis chapter introduces you to the principles applied to digital forensics. In Chapter 6, you learn the strengths and weaknesses of several software packages.\n\nTip\n\nBecause some cases involve computers running legacy OSs, older versions of tools often need to be used in forensics investigations. For example, the tool Norton DiskEdit was last available on the Norton System Works 2000 CD.\n\nAfter your preliminary assessment, you identify the potential challenges in this case. Later, you perform the steps needed to investigate the case, including how to address risks and obstacles. Then you can begin the actual investigation and data retrieval.",

Doing so means you should outline the case details systematically, including the nature of the case, the type of evidence available, and the location of evidence.\n\nIn the company-policy violation case, you have been asked to investigate George Montgomery. Steve Billings had the IT Department confiscate George’s storage media that might contain information about his whereabouts. After talking to George’s co-workers, Steve learned that George has been conducting a personal business on the side using company computers. Therefore, the focus of the case has shifted to include possible employee abuse of company resources. You can begin assessing this case as follows:\n\nSituation—Employee abuse of resources.\n\nNature of the case—Side business conducted on the company computer.\n\nSpecifics of the case—The employee is reportedly conducting a side business on his company computer that involves registering domain names for clients and setting up their Web sites at local ISPs. Co-workers have complained that he’s been spending too much time on his own business and not performing his assigned work duties. Company policy states that all company-owned digital assets are subject to inspection by company management at any time. Employees have no expectation of privacy when operating company computer systems.\n\nType of evidence—Small-capacity USB drive connected to a company computer.\n\nKnown disk format—NTFS.\n\nLocation of evidence—One USB drive recovered from the employee’s assigned computer.\n\nBased on these details, you can determine the case requirements. You now know that the nature of the case involves employee abuse of company resources, and you’re looking for evidence that an employee was conducting a side business using his employer’s computers. On the USB drive retrieved from George’s computer, you’re looking for any information related to Web sites, ISPs, or domain names. You know that the USB drive uses the NTFS file system. To duplicate the USB drive and find deleted and hidden files, you need a reliable digital forensics tool. Because the USB drive has already been retrieved, you don’t need to seize the drive yourself.

Remember that he’s suspected only of resource abuse, and the evidence you obtain might be exculpatory—meaning it could prove his innocence. You must always maintain an unbiased perspective and be objective in your fact-findings. If you are systematic and thorough, you’re more likely to produce consistently reliable results.",

                      "content": "Planning Your Investigation\n\nNow that you have identified the requirements of the Montgomery_72018 case, you can plan your investigation. You have already determined the kind of evidence you need; now you can identify the specific steps to gather the evidence, establish a chain of custody, and perform the forensic analysis. These steps become the basic plan for your investigation and indicate what you should do and when. To investigate the Montgomery_72018 case, you should perform the following general steps. Most of these steps are explained in more detail in the following sections.\n\n1.\n\nAcquire the USB drive from the IT Department, which bagged and tagged the evidence.\n\n2.\n\nComplete an evidence form and establish a chain of custody.\n\n3.\n\nTransport the evidence to your digital forensics lab.\n\n4.\n\nPlace the evidence in an approved secure container A fireproof container locked by a key or combination. .\n\n5.\n\nPrepare your forensic workstation.\n\n6.\n\nRetrieve the evidence from the secure container.\n\n7.\n\nMake a forensic copy of the evidence drive (in this case, the USB drive).\n\n8.\n\nReturn the evidence drive to the secure container.\n\n9.\n\nProcess the copied evidence drive with your digital forensics tools.\n\nTip\n\nThe approved secure container you need in Step 4 should be a locked, fireproof locker or cabinet that has limited access. Limited access means that only you and other authorized personnel can open the secure container.\n\nThe first rule for all investigations is to preserve the evidence, which means it shouldn’t be tampered with or contaminated. Because the IT Department staff confiscated the storage media, you need to go to them for the evidence. The IT Department manager confirms that the storage media has been locked in a secure cabinet since it was retrieved from George’s desk. Keep in mind that even though this case is a company policy matter, many cases are thrown out because the chain of custody can’t be proved or has been broken. When this happens, there’s the possibility that the evidence has been compromised.\n\nTo document the evidence, you record details about the media, including who recovered the evidence and when and who possessed it and when. Use an evidence custody form A printed form indicating who has signed out and been in physical possession of evidence. , also called a chain-of-evidence form, which helps you document what has and has not been done with the original evidence and forensic copies of the evidence. Depending on whether you’re working in law enforcement or private security, you can create an evidence custody form to fit your environment. This form should be easy to read and use. It can contain information for one or several pieces of evidence. Consider creating a single-evidence form A form that dedicates a page for each item retrieved for a case. It allows investigators to\n\nform A form that dedicates a page for each item retrieved for a case. It allows investigators to add more detail about exactly what was done to the evidence each time it was taken from the storage locker. See also evidence custody form. (which lists each piece of evidence on a separate page) and a multi-evidence form An evidence custody form used to list all items associated with a case. See also evidence custody form. (see Figure 1-9), depending on the administrative needs of your investigation.\n\nIf necessary, document how to use your evidence custody form. Clear instructions help users remain consistent when completing the form and ensure that everyone uses the same definitions for collected items. Standardization helps maintain consistent quality for all investigations and prevent confusion and mistakes about the evidence you collect. An evidence custody form usually contains the following information:\n\nCase number—The number your organization assigns when an investigation is initiated.\n\nInvestigating organization—The name of your organization. In large corporations with global facilities, several organizations might be conducting investigations in different geographic areas.\n\nInvestigator—The name of the investigator assigned to the case. If many investigators are assigned, specify the lead investigator’s name.\n\nNature of case—A short description of the case. For example, in the private-sector environment, it might be “data recovery for corporate litigation” or “employee policy violation case.”\n\nLocation evidence was obtained—The exact location where the evidence was collected. If you’re using multi-evidence forms, a new form should be created for each location.\n\nDescription of evidence—A list of the evidence items, such as “hard drive, 250 GB” or “one USB drive, 8 GB.” On a multi-evidence form, write a description for each item of evidence you acquire and possibly include photos.\n\nVendor name—The name of the manufacturer of the computer component. List a 250 GB hard drive, for example, as a “Maxtor 250 GB hard drive,” or describe a USB drive as a “SanDisk 8 GB USB drive.” In later chapters, you see how differences among manufacturers can affect data recovery.\n\nModel number or serial number—List the model number or serial number (if available) of the computer component. Many computer components, including hard drives, memory chips, and expansion slot cards, have model numbers but not serial numbers.\n\nEvidence recovered by—The name of the investigator who recovered the evidence. The chain of custody for evidence starts with this information. If you insert your name, for example, you’re declaring that you have taken control of the evidence. It’s now your responsibility to ensure that nothing damages the evidence and no one tampers with it. The person placing his or her name on this line is responsible for preserving, transporting, and securing the evidence.\n\nDate and time—The date and time the evidence was taken into custody. This information establishes exactly when the chain of custody starts.\n\nEvidence placed in locker—Specifies which approved secure container is used to store evidence and when the evidence was placed in the container.\n\nItem #/Evidence processed by/Disposition of evidence/Date/Time—When you or another authorized investigator retrieves evidence from the evidence locker for processing and analysis, list the item number and your name, and then describe what was done to the evidence.\n\nPage—The forms used to catalog all evidence for each location should have page numbers. List the page number, and indicate the total number of pages for this group of evidence. For example, if you collected 15 pieces of evidence at one location and your form has only 10 lines, you need to fill out two multi-evidence forms. The first form is noted as “Page 1 of 2,” and the second page is noted as “Page 2 of 2.”\n\nFigure 1-10 shows a single-evidence form, which lists only one piece of evidence per page. This form gives you more flexibility in tracking separate pieces of evidence for your chain-of-custody log. It also has more space for descriptions, which is helpful when finalizing the investigation and creating a case report. With this form, you can accurately account for what was done to the evidence and what was found. Use evidence forms as a reference for all actions taken during your investigative analysis.\n\nYou can use both multi-evidence and single-evidence forms in your investigation. By using two forms, you can keep the single-evidence form with the evidence and the multi-evidence form in your report file. Two forms also provide redundancy that can be used as a quality control for evidence.",

                      "content": "Securing Your Evidence\n\nDigital investigations demand that you adjust your procedures to suit the case. For example, if the evidence for a case includes an entire computer system and associated storage media, such as flash drives and large external hard drives, you must be flexible when you account for all these items. Some evidence is small enough to fit into an evidence bag. Other items, such as CPU cabinets, monitors, keyboards, and printers, are too large.\n\nTo secure and catalog the evidence contained in large computer components, you can use large evidence bags Nonstatic bags used to transport computer components and other digital devices. , tape, tags, labels, and other products available from police supply vendors or office supply stores. When gathering products to secure your computer evidence, make sure they are safe and effective to use on computer components. Be cautious when handling any computer component to avoid damaging the component or coming into contact with static electricity, which can destroy digital data. For this reason, make sure you use antistatic bags when collecting computer evidence. Consider using an antistatic pad with an attached wrist strap, too. Both help prevent damage to computer evidence.\n\nNote\n\nThis section focuses on securing computers and related hardware. Devices such as smartphones and cell phones are covered later in Chapter 12.\n\nBe sure to place computer evidence in a well-padded container. Padding prevents damage to the evidence as you transport it to your secure evidence locker, evidence room, or computer lab. Save discarded hard drive boxes, antistatic bags, and packing material for computer hardware when you or others acquire computer devices.\n\nBecause you might not have everything needed to secure your evidence, you have to improvise. Securing evidence often requires building secure containers. If the computer component is large and contained in its own casing, you can use evidence tape to seal all openings on the cabinet. Placing evidence tape over drive bays, insertion slots for power supply cords and USB cables, and any other openings ensures the security of evidence. As a standard practice, you should write your initials on the tape before applying it to the evidence. This practice makes it possible to prove later in court that the evidence hasn’t been tampered with because the casing couldn’t have been opened nor could power have been supplied to the closed casing with this tape in place. If the tape had been replaced, your\n\nbeen supplied to the closed casing with this tape in place. If the tape had been replaced, your initials wouldn’t be present, which would indicate tampering. If you transport a computer, place new disks in disk drives to reduce possible drive damage while you’re moving it.\n\nComputer components require specific temperature and humidity ranges. If it’s too cold, hot, or wet, computer components and magnetic media can be damaged. Even heated car seats can damage digital media, and placing a computer on top of a two-way car radio in the trunk can damage magnetic media. When collecting computer evidence, make sure you have a safe environment for transporting and storing it until a secure evidence container is available.",

In Chapter 2, you examine a complete setup of a digital forensics lab, which is where you conduct your investigations and where most of your equipment and software are located, including secure evidence containers. Be aware that some companies that perform digital investigations also do data recovery, e-discovery, and other related investigations.\n\nRemember the difference between data recovery and digital forensics. In data recovery, typically, the customer or your company just wants the data back. The other key difference is that in data recovery, you usually know what you’re trying to retrieve. In digital forensics, you might have an idea of what you’re searching for, but not necessarily.\n\nTo conduct your investigation and analysis, you must have a specially configured PC known as a forensic workstation A workstation set up to allow copying forensic evidence, whether it’s on a hard drive, flash drive, or the cloud. It usually has software preloaded and ready to use. , which is a computer loaded with additional bays and forensics software. Depending on your needs, a forensic workstation can use the following operating systems:\n\nMS-DOS 6.22\n\nWindows 95, 98, or Me\n\nWindows NT 3.5 or 4.0\n\nWindows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, or 10\n\nLinux\n\nMac OS X and macOS\n\nTip\n\nChapters 2 and 6 cover the software resources you need and the forensics lab and workstation in detail. Visit www.digitalintelligence.com to examine the specifications of the Forensic Recovery of Evidence Device (F.R.E.D.) unit or www.forensiccomputers.com to look at current products.\n\nIf you start any operating system while you’re examining a hard disk, the OS alters the evidence disk by writing data to the Recycle Bin and corrupts the quality and integrity of the evidence you’re trying to preserve. Chapter 5 covers which files Windows updates automatically at startup. Newer Windows OSs also record the serial numbers of hard drives and CPUs in a file, which can be difficult to recover.\n\nOf all the Microsoft OSs, the least intrusive (in terms of changing data) to disks is MS-DOS 6.22. With the continued evolution of Microsoft OSs, it’s not always practical to use older MS-DOS platforms, however. Many older digital forensics acquisition tools work in the MS-DOS environment. These tools can operate from an MS-DOS window in Windows 98 or from the command prompt in Windows 2000 and later. Some of their functions are disabled or generate error messages when run in these OSs, however.\n\nNewer file system formats, such as NTFS, are accessible—that is, readable—only from Windows NT and later or any Linux OS. You can use one of several write-blockers that enable you to boot to Windows without writing data to the evidence drive. In Chapter 3, you learn more about write-blockers and some inexpensive alternatives for preserving data during an acquisition.\n\nMany hardware write-blockers that connect to USB or FireWire ports are on the market. Several vendors sell write-blockers, including Digital Intelligence Ultra-Kit, UltraBlock, FireFly, FireChief 800, and USB Write Blocker; WiebeTECH Forensic DriveDock; Guidance Software FastBloc; Paralan’s SCSI Write Blockers; Tableu UltraBlock SAS Write Blocker; and Intelligent Computer Solutions (www.ics-iq.com) Image LinkMASSter Forensics Hard Case.\n\nSoftware write-blockers are available, too. Typically, these write-blockers require a bootable DVD or USB drive that runs an independent OS in a suspect computer’s RAM. For more information on software write-blockers, see http://forensicsoft.com. Windows products are being developed that make performing disk forensics easier. However, because Windows has limitations in performing disk forensics, you need to develop skills in acquiring data with Linux. In later chapters, you learn more about using these other tools. Keep in mind that no single digital forensics tool can recover everything. Each tool and OS has its own strengths and weaknesses, so develop skills with as many tools as possible to become an effective digital investigator. Appendix D has additional information on how to use\n\nto become an effective digital investigator. Appendix D has additional information on how to use MS-DOS for data acquisitions.",

This process is usually called “acquiring an image,” “making an image,” or “forensic copy.” is a bit-by-bit copy (also known as a “forensic copy”) of the original drive or storage medium and is an exact duplicate. The more exact the copy, the better chance you have of retrieving the evidence you need from the disk. This process is usually referred to as “acquiring an image” or “making an image” of a suspect drive. A bit-stream copy is different from a simple backup copy of a disk. Backup software can copy or compress only files that are stored in a folder or are of a known file type. Backup software can’t copy deleted files and e-mails or recover file fragments.\n\nA bit-stream image The file where the bitstream copy is stored; usually referred to as an “image,” “image save,” or “image file.” is the file containing the bit-stream copy of all data on a disk or disk partition. For simplicity, it’s usually referred to as an “image,” “image save,” or “image file.” To create an exact image of an evidence disk, copying the image to a target disk that’s identical to the evidence disk is preferable (Figure 1-11). The target disk’s manufacturer and model, in general, should be the same as the original disk’s manufacturer and model. If the target disk is identical to the original, the size in bytes and sectors of both disks should also be the same. Some image acquisition tools can accommodate a target disk that’s a different size than the original.

                  "content": "Analyzing Your Digital Evidence\n\nWhen you analyze digital evidence, your job is to recover the data. If users have deleted or overwritten files on a disk, the disk contains deleted files and file fragments in addition to existing files. Remember that as files are deleted, the space they occupied becomes free space—meaning it can be used for new files that are saved or files that expand as data is added to them. The files that were deleted are still on the disk until a new file is saved to the same physical location, overwriting the original file. In the meantime, those files can still be retrieved. Forensics tools such as Autopsy can retrieve deleted files for use as evidence.\n\nNote\n\nBefore doing the next activity, you need to download Autopsy for Windows, a free forensics tool from Sleuth Kit. The version used throughout this book is 4.3.0. Download Autopsy from https://sourceforge.net/projects/autopsy/files/autopsy/4.3.0/, and then install it. For detailed information on using Autopsy, see http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.3/. For an explanation of the user interface, see http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.3/uilayout_page.html.\n\nIn the following steps, you analyze George Montgomery’s USB drive. The first task is to configure Autopsy for a new case and analyze the image file of George Montgomery’s USB drive. To perform the analysis, follow these steps:\n\nNote\n\nBefore beginning this activity, create a C:\\Work\\Chap01\\Chapter folder (referred to as your “work folder” in steps). Download to this work folder the Ch01InChap01.exe file from this chapter’s downloads section on the student companion site for this book.\n\n1.\n\nDouble-click the Ch01InChap01.exe file in File Explorer to uncompress it into InChap01.dd. Start Autopsy for Windows.\n\n2.\n\nIn Autopsy’s main window, click the Create New Case button. In the New Case Information window, enter InChap01 in the Case Name text box (see Figure 1-12), and click Browse next to the Base Directory text box. Navigate to and click your work folder. Make sure the Single-user option button is selected for Case Type, and then click Next.\n\n3.\n\nIn the Additional Information window, type InChap01 in the Case Number text box and your name in the Examiner text box (see Figure 1-13), and then click Finish to start the Add Data Source Wizard.\n\n4.\n\nIn the Select Data Source window (see Figure 1-14), click the Select data source type list arrow, and click Disk Image or VM file. Click the Browse button next to the “Browse for an image file” text box, navigate to and click your work folder and the Ch01InChap01.dd file, and then click Open. Click Next.\n\n5.\n\nKeep the default settings in the Configure Ingest Modules window. Click Next and then Finish.\n\nNext, follow these steps to display the contents of the acquired data:\n\n1.\n\nIn the Tree Viewer pane on the left, click to expand Views, File Types, By Extension, and Documents (see Figure 1-15).\n\n2.\n\nUnder Documents, click Office. In the Result Viewer (upper-right pane), click the first file, Billing Letter.doc , to display its contents in the Content Viewer (lower-right pane).\n\n3.\n\nRight-click Billing Letter.doc , point to Tag File, and click Tag and Comment.\n\n4.\n\nIn the Create Tag dialog box, click the New Tag Name button shown in Figure 1-16. In the New Tag section, type Recovered Office Documents in the Tag Name text box, click OK, and then click OK again.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Result Viewer pane, Ctrl+click Billing Letter.doc , Income.xls , Regrets.doc , f0000000.doc , and f0000049.doc to select these files, and then release the Ctrl key. Right-click the highlighted files shown in Figure 1-17, point to Tag File and then Quick Tag, and then click Recovered Office Documents.\n\n6.\n\nUnder Documents in the Tree Viewer pane, click Plain Text to display more recovered files.\n\n7.\n\nIn the Result Viewer pane, select the files listed in Step 5 again, right-click the selection, point to Tag File and then Quick Tag, and then click Follow Up. Leave Autopsy running for the next activity.\n\nThe next step is analyzing the data and searching for information related to the complaint. Data analysis can be the most time-consuming task, even when you know exactly what to look for in the evidence. The method for locating evidentiary artifacts is to search for specific known data values. Data values can be unique words or nonprintable characters, such as hexadecimal codes. There are also printable character codes that can’t be generated from a keyboard, such as the copyright (©) or registered trademark (™) symbols. Many digital forensics programs can search for character strings (letters and numbers) and hexadecimal values, such as 0xA9 for the copyright symbol or 0xAE for the registered trademark symbol. All these searchable data values are referred to as “keywords.”\n\nNote\n\nHexadecimal values are typically preceded with a zero and the letter x to clearly identify what they represent.\n\nWith Autopsy, you can search for keywords of interest in the case. For this case, you need to find any files associated with George Montgomery. Follow these steps to search for any reference to the name “George”:\n\n1.\n\nClick the Keyword Search button at the far upper right, type George in the text box (see Figure 1-18), and then click Search.\n\n2.\n\nIn the Result Viewer pane, a new tab named Keyword search 1 opens. Click each file to view its contents in the Content Viewer (see Figure 1-19). Look for files containing the name “George.”\n\n3.\n\nClick the Keyword Lists button at the far upper right, click the Email Addresses check box, and then click Search.\n\n4.\n\nIn the Result Viewer pane, a new tab named Keyword search 2 opens. Click each file to view its contents in the Content Viewer pane and examine all e-mail addresses found in the search. Leave Autopsy running so that you can learn about more of its features in the next section.",

The files on George’s USB drive indicate that he was conducting a side business on his company computer. Now that you have retrieved and analyzed the evidence, you need to find the answers to the following questions to write the final report:\n\nHow did George’s manager acquire the disk?\n\nDid George perform the work on a laptop, which is his own property? If so, did he conduct business transactions on his break or during his lunch hour?\n\nAt what times of the day was George using the non-work-related files? How did you retrieve this information?\n\nWhich company policies apply?\n\nAre there any other items that need to be considered?\n\nWhen you write your report, state what you did and what you found. The report you generate with a forensics tool gives an account of the steps you took. As part of your final report, depending on guidance from management or legal counsel, include this report file to document your work. In any digital investigation, you should be able to repeat the steps you took and produce the same results. This capability is referred to as repeatable findings Being able to obtain the same results every time from a digital forensics examination. ; without it, your work product has no value as evidence.\n\nIn addition to writing a report, keep a written journal of everything you do. Your notes can be used in court, so be mindful of what you write or e-mail, even to a fellow investigator. Often these journals start out as handwritten notes, but you can transcribe them to electronic format periodically.\n\nBasic report writing involves answering the six Ws: who, what, when, where, why, and how. In addition to these basic facts, you must also explain computer and network processes. Typically, your reader is a senior personnel manager, a lawyer, or occasionally a judge who might have little computer knowledge. Identify your reader and write the report for that person. Provide explanations for processes and how systems and their components work.\n\nYour organization might have templates to use when writing reports. Depending on your organization’s needs and requirements, your report must describe the findings from your analysis. The reports generated by forensics tools generally list your examination and data recovery findings. Some digital forensics tools also generate a log file of all actions taken during your examination and analysis. Integrating a log file from these other tools can enhance your final report. When describing the findings, consider writing your narrative first and then placing the log file at the end of the report, with references to it in the main narrative. Chapter 14 covers writing final reports for investigations in more detail.\n\nIn the Montgomery_72018 case, you want to show what evidence exists proving that George had his own business registering domain names. You should include a list of his clients’ names, his income from this business, and any correspondence he wrote to clients about their accounts. The time and date stamps on the files are during work hours, so you should include this information, too. Eventually, you hand the evidence file to your supervisor or to Steve, George’s manager, who then decides on a course of action.",

In a criminal case, a suspect is charged with a criminal offense, such as burglary, murder, molestation, or fraud. To determine whether there was a computer crime, an investigator asks questions such as the following: What was the tool used to commit the crime? Was it a simple trespass? Was it a theft or vandalism? Did the perpetrator infringe on someone else’s rights by cyberstalking or e-mail harassment?\n\nNote\n\nLaws, including procedural rules, vary by jurisdiction. Therefore, this book points out when items accepted in U.S. courts don’t stand up in other courts. Lately, a major issue has been that European Union (EU) privacy laws are more stringent than U.S. privacy laws. Issues related to international companies are still being defined. Over the past few decades, more companies have been consolidating into global entities. As a result, internal company investigations can involve laws of multiple countries. For example, a company has a subsidiary operating in Australia. An employee at that subsidiary is suspected of fraud, and as part of your investigation, you need to seize his cell phone. Under U.S. law, you can if he used it on company property and synchronized it with the company network.\n\nU.S. law, you can if he used it on company property and synchronized it with the company network. Under Australian law, you can’t.\n\nComputers and networks might be only tools used to commit crimes and are, therefore, analogous to the lockpick a burglar uses to break into a house. For this reason, many states have added specific language to criminal codes to define crimes involving computers. States such as Alabama have wording such as “willfully or without authorization” and specify what dollar amount qualifies as a misdemeanor or a felony. For example, they have expanded the definition of laws for crimes such as theft to include taking data from a computer without the owner’s permission, so computer theft is now on a par with shoplifting or car theft. States have also enacted specific criminal statutes that address computer-related crimes but typically don’t include digital issues in standard trespass, theft,\n\ncomputer-related crimes but typically don’t include digital issues in standard trespass, theft, vandalism, or burglary laws. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was passed in 1986, but specific state laws were generally developed later.\n\nNote\n\nFor information on how each state defines and addresses computer-related crimes, see http://statelaws.findlaw.com/criminal-laws/computer-crimes.html.\n\nMany serious crimes involve computers, smartphones, and other digital devices. The most notorious are those involving sexual exploitation of minors. Digital images are stored on hard disks, flash drives, removable hard drives, and the cloud and are circulated on the Internet. Other computer crimes concern missing children and adults because information about missing people is often found on computers. Drug dealers, car theft rings, and other criminals often keep information about transactions on their computers, laptops, smartphones, and other devices.",

In general, however, a criminal case follows three stages: the complaint, the investigation, and the prosecution. Someone files a complaint, and then a specialist investigates the complaint and, with the help of a prosecutor, collects evidence and builds a case. If the evidence is sufficient, the case might proceed to trial.\n\nA criminal investigation generally begins when someone finds evidence of or witnesses an illegal act. The witness or victim makes an allegation A charge made against someone or something before proof has been found. to the police, an accusation of fact that a crime has been committed.\n\nA police officer interviews the complainant and writes a report about the crime. The law enforcement agency processes the report, and management decides to start an investigation or log the information into a police blotter, which provides a record of information about crimes that have been committed previously. Criminals often repeat actions in their illegal activities, and these patterns can be discovered by examining police blotters. This historical knowledge is useful when conducting investigations, especially in high-technology crimes. Blotters now are generally electronic files, often structured as databases, so they can be searched more easily than the old paper blotters.\n\nTip\n\nTo see an example of a police blotter, go to http://spdblotter.seattle.gov.\n\nNot every police officer is a computer expert. Some are computer novices; others might be trained to recognize what they can retrieve from a computer disk. To differentiate the training and experience officers have, ISO standard 27037 (www.iso.org/standard/44381.html) defines two categories. A Digital Evidence First Responder (DEFR) A professional who secures digital evidence at the scene and ensures its viability while transporting it to the lab. has the skill and training to arrive on an incident scene, assess the situation, and take precautions to acquire and preserve evidence.

You should have DES training to conduct the examination of systems and manage the digital forensics aspects of the case. You start by assessing the scope of the case, which includes the device’s OS, hardware, and peripheral devices. You then determine whether resources are available to process all the evidence. Determine whether you have the right tools to collect and analyze evidence and whether you need to call on other specialists to assist in collecting and processing evidence.

As an investigator, you must then present the collected evidence with a report to the government’s attorney. Depending on the community and the nature of the crime, the prosecutor’s title varies by jurisdiction.\n\nIn a criminal or public-sector case, if the police officer or investigator has sufficient cause to support a search warrant, the prosecuting attorney might direct him or her to submit an affidavit A notarized document, given under penalty of perjury, that investigators create to detail their findings. This document is often used to justify issuing a warrant or to deal with abuse in a corporation. Also called a “declaration” when the document isn’t notarized. (also called a “declaration”).

(You learn more about affidavits and declarations in Chapter 14.)\n\nIn general, after a judge approves and signs a search warrant, it’s ready to be executed, meaning a DEFR can collect evidence as defined by the warrant. After you collect the evidence, you process and analyze it to determine whether a crime actually occurred. The evidence can then be presented in court in a hearing or trial.

A warning banner Text displayed on computer screens when people log on to a company computer; this text states ownership of the computer and specifies appropriate use of the machine or Internet access. usually appears when a computer starts or connects to the company intranet, network, or virtual private network (VPN) and informs end users that the organization reserves the right to inspect computer systems and network traffic at will. (An end user is a person using a computer to perform routine tasks other than system administration.) If this right isn’t stated explicitly, employees might have an assumed right of privacy when using a company’s computer systems and network\n\nmight have an assumed right of privacy when using a company’s computer systems and network accesses. Figure 1-7 shows a sample warning banner.\n\nA warning banner asserts the right to conduct an investigation and notifies the user. By displaying a strong, well-worded warning banner, an organization owning computer equipment doesn’t need a search warrant or court order as required under Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure rules to seize the equipment. In a company with a well-defined policy, this right to inspect or search at will applies to both criminal activity and company policy violations. Keep in mind, however, that your country’s laws might differ. For example, in some countries, even though the company has the right to seize computers at any time, if employees are suspected of a criminal act, they must be informed at that time.\n\nThe following list recommends phrases to include in warning banners. Before using these warnings, consult with the organization’s legal department for other required legal notices for your work area or department. Depending on the type of organization, the following text can be used in internal warning banners:\n\nAccess to this system and network is restricted.\n\nUse of this system and network is for official business only.\n\nSystems and networks are subject to monitoring at any time by the owner.\n\nUsing this system implies consent to monitoring by the owner.\n\nUnauthorized or illegal users of this system or network will be subject to discipline or prosecution.\n\nUsers of this system agree that they have no expectation of privacy relating to all activity performed on this system.\n\nTip\n\nThe DOJ document at www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/docs/ssmanual2009.pdf has several examples of warning banners.\n\nAn organization such as a community college might simply state that systems and networks are subject to observation and monitoring at any time because members of the local community who aren’t staff or students might use the facilities. A for-profit organization, on the other hand, could have proprietary information on its network and use all the phrases suggested in the preceding list. Guests, such as employees of business partners, might be allowed to use the system. The text that’s displayed when a guest attempts to log on can include warnings similar to the following:\n\nThis system is the property of Company X.\n\nThis system is for authorized use only; unauthorized access is a violation of law and violators will be prosecuted.\n\nAll activity, software, network traffic, and communications are subject to monitoring.\n\nAs a private-sector digital investigator, make sure a company displays a clearly worded warning banner. Without a banner, your authority to inspect might conflict with the user’s expectation of privacy, and a court might have to determine the issue of authority to inspect. State laws vary on the expectation of privacy, but all states accept the concept of a waiver of the expectation of privacy. Additionally, the EU and its member nations impose substantial penalties for personal information that crosses national boundaries without the person’s consent. For example, if your company is conducting an investigation at its subsidiary in the EU, you might not be able to acquire a network drive without notifying certain parties or making sure consent documents are in place.\n\nSome might argue that written policies are all that are necessary. However, in the actual prosecution of cases, warning banners have been critical in determining that a user didn’t have an expectation of privacy for information stored on the system. A warning banner has the additional advantage of being easier to present in trial as an exhibit than a policy manual. Government agencies, such as the Department of Energy, NASA, Lawrence Livermore Labs, and even public libraries, now require warning banners on all computer terminals on their systems. Many corporations also require warning banners as part of the logon/startup process.",

During public investigations, you search for evidence to support criminal allegations. During private investigations, you search for evidence to support allegations of violations of a company’s rules or an attack on its assets. Three types of situations are common in private-sector environments:\n\nAbuse or misuse of digital assets\n\nE-mail abuse\n\nInternet abuse\n\nMost digital investigations in the private sector involve misuse of digital assets. Typically, this misuse is referred to as “company rules violation.” Digital abuse complaints often center on e-mail and Internet misuse by employees but could involve other digital resources, such as using company software to produce a product for personal profit. The scope of an e-mail investigation ranges from excessive use of a company’s e-mail system for personal use to making threats or harassing others via e-mail. Some common e-mail abuses involve transmitting offensive messages. These types of messages can create a hostile work environment An environment in which employees can’t perform their assigned duties because of the actions of others. In the workplace, these actions include sending threatening\n\nbecause of the actions of others. In the workplace, these actions include sending threatening or demeaning e-mail or a co-worker viewing pornographic or hate sites. that can result in an employee’s civil lawsuit against a company that does nothing to prevent or respond to it (in other words, implicitly condones the e-mail abuse).\n\nDigital investigators also examine Internet abuse. Employees’ abuse of Internet privileges ranges from excessive use, such as spending all day Web surfing, to viewing pornographic pictures on the Internet while at work. An extreme instance of Internet abuse is viewing contraband (illegal) pornographic images, such as child pornography. Viewing contraband images is a criminal act in most jurisdictions, and digital investigators must handle this situation with the highest level of professionalism and notify law enforcement. By enforcing policies consistently, a company minimizes its liability exposure. The role of a digital forensics examiner is to give management personnel complete and accurate information so that they can verify and correct abuse problems in an organization. (In later\n\ninformation so that they can verify and correct abuse problems in an organization. (In later chapters, you learn the procedures for conducting these types of investigations.)\n\nActions that seem related to internal abuse could also have criminal or civil liability. Because any civil investigation can become a criminal investigation, you must treat all evidence you collect with the highest level of security and accountability. Later in this book, you learn the Federal Rules of Evidence (processes to ensure the chain of custody) and how to apply them to digital investigations.\n\nSimilarly, your private-sector investigation might seem to involve a civil, noncriminal matter, but as you progress through your analysis, you might identify a criminal matter, too. Because of this possibility, always remember that your work can come under the scrutiny of the civil or criminal legal system. The Federal Rules of Evidence are the same for civil and criminal matters. By applying the rules to all investigations uniformly, you eliminate any concerns about the admissibility of the evidence you develop. These standards are emphasized throughout this book.\n\nNote\n\nThe silver-platter doctrine used to allow a civilian or private-sector investigative agent to deliver evidence obtained in a manner that violated the Fourth Amendment to a law enforcement agency. However, this doctrine was ruled unconstitutional in 1960 (see Elkins v. United States, 1960).\n\nRemember that a police officer is a law enforcement agent. A private-sector investigator’s job is to minimize risk to the company. After you turn over evidence to law enforcement and begin working under their direction, you become an agent of law enforcement, subject to the same restrictions on search and seizure as a law enforcement agent. A law enforcement agent can’t ask you, as a private citizen, to obtain evidence that requires a warrant. The rules controlling the use of evidence collected by private citizens vary by jurisdiction, so check the law if you’re investigating a case outside the United States.\n\nLitigation is costly, so after you have assembled evidence, offending employees are usually disciplined. However, when you discover that a criminal act involving a third-party victim has been committed, you might have a legal and moral obligation to turn the information over to law enforcement. In the next section, you learn about situations in which criminal evidence must be separated from any company proprietary information.",

For example, an employee brings her personal tablet to work and connects it to the company’s wireless network. As the employee synchronizes information on the tablet with information in the company network, she copies some data in the tablet to the company network. During the synchronization, data on the company computer or network might be placed on the tablet, too. In this case, at least one question is “Does the information on the tablet belong to the company or the employee?”\n\nNow suppose the company gave the employee the tablet as a holiday bonus. Can the company claim rights to this device? Similar issues come up when an employee brings in a smartphone and connects it to the company network. What rules apply? Because digital devices are part of daily life, you’ll encounter these issues often.

For the purposes of this discussion, however, they fall into two categories: public-sector investigations and private-sector investigations (see Figure 1-4).\n\nIn general, public-sector investigations involve government agencies responsible for criminal investigations and prosecution. Government agencies range from municipal, county, and state or provincial police departments to federal law enforcement agencies. These organizations must observe legal guidelines of their jurisdictions, such as Article 8 in the Charter of Rights of Canada and the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution restricting government search and seizure The legal act of acquiring evidence for an investigation. See also Fourth Amendment. (see Figure 1-5).

However, criminal acts, such as corporate espionage, can also occur. So although private-sector investigations often start as civil cases, they can develop into criminal cases; likewise, a criminal case can have implications leading to a civil case.

The purpose of having confidential communications is to promote honest and open dialogue between an attorney and client. This confidential information must not be shared with unauthorized people. rules for an attorney, you must keep all findings confidential. The attorney you’re working for is the ultimate authority over the investigation. For investigations of this nature, attorneys typically request that you extract all data from drives. It’s your responsibility to comply with the attorney’s directions. Because of the large quantities of data a drive can contain, the attorney will want to know\n\nBecause of the large quantities of data a drive can contain, the attorney will want to know about everything of interest on the drives.\n\nMany attorneys like to have printouts of the data you have recovered, but printouts can pose problems when you have log files with several thousand pages of data or CAD drawing programs that can be read only by proprietary programs. You need to persuade and educate many attorneys on how digital evidence can be viewed electronically. In addition, learn how to teach attorneys and paralegals to sort through files so that you can help them efficiently analyze the huge amount of data a forensic examination produces.\n\nYou can also encounter problems if you find data in the form of binary files, such as CAD drawings. Examining these files requires using the CAD program that created them. In addition, engineering companies often have specialized drafting programs. Discovery demands for lawsuits involving a product that caused injury or death requires extracting design plans for attorneys and expert witnesses to review. You’re responsible for locating the programs for these design plans so that attorneys and expert witnesses can view the evidence files.\n\nThe following list shows the basic steps for conducting an ACP case:\n\n1.\n\nRequest a memo from the attorney directing you to start the investigation. The memorandum must state that the investigation is privileged communication and list your name and any other associates’ names assigned to the case.\n\n2.\n\nRequest a list of keywords of interest to the investigation.\n\n3.\n\nAfter you have received the memorandum, initiate the investigation and analysis. Any findings you made before receiving the memorandum are subject to discovery by the opposing attorney.\n\n4.\n\nFor drive examinations, make two bit-stream images (discussed later in this chapter) of the drive, using a different tool for each image. This approach is advisable because every tool has its strengths and weaknesses. If you have large enough storage drives, make each bit-stream image uncompressed (refer to Chapter 3) so that if it becomes corrupt, you can still examine uncorrupted areas with your preferred forensics analysis tool.\n\n5.\n\nVerify the hash values on all files on the original and re-created disks or its image file.\n\n6.\n\nMethodically examine every portion of the drive (both allocated and unallocated data areas) and extract all data.\n\n7.\n\nRun keyword searches on allocated and unallocated disk space. Follow up the searches to determine whether the results contain information that supports the case.\n\n8.\n\nFor Windows OSs, use specialty tools to analyze and extract data from the Registry, such as AccessData Registry Viewer or a Registry viewer program (discussed in more detail in Chapter 5). Use the Edit, Find menu option in Registry Editor, for example, to search for keywords of interest to the investigation.\n\n9.\n\nFor binary files, such as CAD drawings, find the correct program and, if possible, make printouts of the binary file content. If the files are too large, load the specialty program on a separate workstation with the recovered binary files so that the attorney can view them.\n\n10.\n\nFor unallocated data recovery, use a tool that removes or replaces nonprintable data.\n\n11.\n\nConsolidate all recovered data from the evidence bit-stream image into well-organized folders and subfolders. Store the recovered data output, using a logical and easy-to-follow storage method for the attorney or paralegal.\n\nHere are some other guidelines to remember for ACP cases:\n\nMinimize all written communication with the attorney; use the telephone when you need to ask questions or provide information related to the case.\n\nAny documentation written to the attorney must contain a header stating that it’s “Privileged Legal Communication—Confidential Work Product,” as defined under the attorney-work-product rule.\n\nAssist the attorney and paralegal in analyzing the data.\n\nIf you have difficulty complying with the directions or don’t understand the directives in the memo, contact the attorney and explain the problem. Always keep an open line of verbal communication with the attorney during these types of investigations. If you’re communicating via e-mail, use encryption or another secure e-mail service for all messages.",

                      "content": "Interviews and Interrogations in High-Tech Investigations\n\nBecoming a skilled interviewer and interrogator can take many years of experience. Typically, a private-sector digital investigator is a technical person acquiring the evidence for an investigation. Many large organizations have full-time security investigators with years of training and experience in criminal and civil investigations and interviewing techniques. Few of these investigators have any computing or network technical skills, so you might be asked to assist in interviewing or interrogating a suspect when you have performed a forensic disk analysis on that suspect’s machine.\n\nAn interrogation is different from an interview. An interview A conversation conducted to collect information from a witness or suspect about specific facts related to an investigation. is usually conducted to collect information from a witness or suspect about specific facts related to an investigation. An interrogation The process of trying to get a suspect to confess to a specific incident or crime. is the process of trying to get a suspect to confess to a specific incident or crime. An investigator might change from an interview to an interrogation when talking to a witness or suspect. The more experience and training investigators have in the art of interviewing and interrogating, the more easily they can determine whether a witness is credible and possibly a suspect.\n\nYour role as a digital investigator is to instruct the investigator conducting the interview on what questions to ask and what the answers should be. As you build rapport with the investigator, he or she might ask you to question the suspect. Watching a skilled interrogator is a learning experience in human relations skills. If you’re asked to assist in an interview or interrogation, prepare yourself by answering the following questions:\n\nWhat questions do I need to ask the suspect to get the vital information about the case?\n\nDo I know what I’m talking about, or will I have to research the topic or technology related to the investigation?\n\nDo I need additional questions to cover other indirect issues related to the investigation?\n\nCommon interview and interrogation errors include being unprepared for the interview or interrogation and not having the right questions or enough questions to increase your depth of knowledge. Make sure you don’t run out of conversation topics; you need to keep the conversation friendly to gain the suspect’s confidence. Avoid doubting your own skills, which might show the suspect you lack confidence in your ability. The ingredients for a successful interview or interrogation include the following:\n\nBeing patient throughout the session\n\nRepeating or rephrasing questions to zero in on specific facts from a reluctant witness or suspect\n\nBeing tenacious",

This section offers some guidelines on how to deal with industrial espionage investigations. Be aware that cases dealing with foreign nationals might be violations of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or Export Administration Regulations (EAR). For more information on ITAR, see the U.S. Department of State’s Web site (www.state.gov; substitute the actual state name or a shortened version for state) or do an Internet search for “International Traffic in Arms Regulations.” For EAR information, see the U.S. Department of Commerce Web site (www.doc.gov) or do an Internet search for “Export Administration\n\nDepartment of Commerce Web site (www.doc.gov) or do an Internet search for “Export Administration Regulations.”\n\nUnlike the other private-sector investigations covered in this section, all suspected industrial espionage cases should be treated as criminal investigations. The techniques described here are for private network environments and internal investigations that haven’t yet been reported to law enforcement officials. Make sure you don’t become an agent of law enforcement by filing a complaint of a suspected espionage case before substantiating the allegation. The following list includes staff you might need when planning an industrial espionage investigation. This list isn’t exhaustive, so use your knowledge to improve on these recommendations:\n\nThe digital investigator who’s responsible for disk forensic examinations\n\nThe technology specialist who is knowledgeable about the suspected compromised technical data\n\nThe network specialist who can perform log analysis and set up network monitors to trap network communication of possible suspects\n\nThe threat assessment specialist (typically an attorney) who’s familiar with federal and state laws and regulations related to ITAR or EAR and industrial espionage\n\nTip\n\nThe International Competition Network has established guidelines (available at www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc627.pdf) for digital evidence gathering in private-sector settings; they’re used by more than 90 jurisdictions.\n\nIn addition, consider the following guidelines when initiating an international espionage investigation:\n\nDetermine whether this investigation involves a possible industrial espionage incident, and then determine whether it falls under ITAR or EAR.\n\nConsult with corporate attorneys and upper management if the investigations must be conducted discreetly.\n\nDetermine what information is needed to substantiate the allegation of industrial espionage.\n\nGenerate a list of keywords for disk forensics and network monitoring.\n\nList and collect resources needed for the investigation.\n\nDetermine the goal and scope of the investigation; consult with management and the company’s attorneys on how much work you should do.\n\nInitiate the investigation after approval from management, and make regular reports of your activities and findings.\n\nThe following are planning considerations for industrial espionage investigations:\n\nExamine all e-mail of suspected employees, both company-provided e-mail and free Web-based services.\n\nSearch Internet forums or blogs for any postings related to the incident.\n\nInitiate physical surveillance with cameras on people or things of interest to the investigation.\n\nIf available, examine all facility physical access logs for sensitive areas, which might include secure areas where smart badges or video surveillance recordings are used.\n\nIf there’s a suspect, determine his or her location in relation to the vulnerable resource that was compromised.\n\nStudy the suspect’s work habits.\n\nCollect all incoming and outgoing phone logs to see whether any unique or unusual places were called.\n\nWhen conducting an industrial espionage case, follow these basic steps:\n\n1.\n\nGather all personnel assigned to the investigation and brief them on the plan and any concerns.\n\n2.\n\nGather the resources needed to conduct the investigation.\n\n3.\n\nStart the investigation by placing surveillance systems, such as cameras and network monitors, at key locations.\n\n4.\n\nDiscreetly gather any additional evidence, such as the suspect’s computer drive, and make a bit-stream image for follow-up examination.\n\n5.\n\nCollect all log data from networks and e-mail servers, and examine them for unique items that might relate to the investigation.\n\n6.\n\nReport regularly to management and corporate attorneys on your investigation’s status and current findings.\n\n7.\n\nReview the investigation’s scope with management and corporate attorneys to determine whether it needs to be expanded and more resources added.",
