                  "content": "Identifying Duties of the Lab Manager and Staff\n\nThe ANAB states that each lab should have specific objectives that a parent organization and the lab’s director or manager have determined. The lab manager sets up processes for managing cases and reviews them regularly. Besides performing general management tasks, such as promoting group consensus in decision making, maintaining fiscal responsibility for lab needs, and enforcing ethical standards (covered in Chapters 15 and 16) among staff members, the lab manager plans updates for the lab, such as new hardware and software purchases.\n\nThe lab manager also establishes and promotes quality assurance processes for the lab’s staff to follow, such as outlining what to do when a case arrives, logging evidence, specifying who can enter the lab, and establishing guidelines for filing reports. To ensure the lab’s efficiency, the lab manager also sets reasonable production schedules for processing work.\n\nA typical investigation involves seizing a hard disk and other media, such as USB drives; making forensic copies of them; evaluating evidence; and filing a report. A forensics analysis of a 6 TB disk, for example, can take several days or weeks and often involves running imaging software overnight and on weekends. This means one of the forensic workstations in the lab is occupied for that time, which can be 20 hours or more. Based on past experience, the lab manager can estimate how many cases each investigator can handle and when to expect a preliminary and final report for each case.\n\nThe lab manager creates and monitors lab policies for staff and provides a safe and secure workplace for staff and evidence. Above all, the lab manager accounts for all activities the lab’s staff conducts to complete its work. Tracking cases such as e-mail abuse, Internet misuse, and illicit activities can justify the funds spent on a lab.\n\nStaff members in a forensics lab should have enough training to perform their tasks. Necessary skills include hardware and software knowledge, including OSs and file types, and deductive reasoning. Their work is reviewed regularly by the lab manager and their peers to ensure quality. Staff members are also responsible for continuing technical training to update their investigative and computer skills and maintaining a record of the training they have completed. Many vendors and organizations hold annual or quarterly training seminars that offer certification exams.\n\nThe ANAB Web site summarizes the requirements of managing a digital forensics lab, handling and preserving evidence, performing laboratory procedures, setting personnel requirements, and encouraging professional development. The site also provides a user license for printed and online manuals of lab management guidelines. ANAB stresses that each lab should maintain an up-to-date library of resources in its field. For digital forensics, these resources include software, hardware information, and technical journals.",

                  "content": "Lab Budget Planning\n\nTo conduct a professional digital investigation, you need to understand the cost of your lab operation. Lab costs can be broken down into monthly, quarterly, and annual expenses. The better you understand these expenses, the better you can delegate resources for each investigation. Using a spreadsheet program helps you keep track of past investigation expenses so that you can extrapolate expected future costs. Remember that expenses include purchasing computer hardware and software, renting facility space, and training personnel.\n\nWhen creating a budget, start by estimating the number of cases your lab expects to examine and identifying the types of computers you’re likely to examine, such as Windows PCs, Apple systems, or Linux workstations. For example, suppose you work for a state police agency that’s planning to provide digital investigation services for the entire state. You could start by collecting state crime statistics for the current year and several previous years to determine types of computers or other devices associated with these crimes. Criminal behavior often reflects sales trends for certain computing systems. Because most consumers use Intel and AMD PCs, and most of these computers run Windows, the same is likely true of computers used in crimes. Verify this trend by determining how often each\n\nsame is likely true of computers used in crimes. Verify this trend by determining how often each type of system is used in a crime. List the number of crimes committed that involve Windows, Linux/UNIX, and Apple computers. In addition to estimating resources for digital investigations, you should also determine what resources will be needed to examine mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.\n\nIf you can’t find detailed information on the types of computers and OSs used in digital crimes, gather enough information to make an educated guess. Your goal is to build a baseline for the types and numbers of systems you can expect to investigate. In addition to the historical data you compile, identify any future trends that could affect your lab, such as a new version of an OS or an increase in the number of computers involved in crime.\n\nNext, estimate how many investigations you might conduct involving computer systems used less often to help determine how many tools you need to examine these systems. For example, if you learn that on average, one Macintosh is involved in a criminal investigation each month, you probably need only one or two software tools to conduct a forensic analysis on Macintosh file systems.\n\nFigure 2-1 shows a table of statistics from a Uniform Crime Report Information collected at the federal, state, and local levels to determine the types and frequencies of crimes committed. that identifies the number of hard disk types, such as SATA or SCSI, and the OS used to commit crimes. Annual Uniform Crime Reports are generated at the federal, state, and local levels to show the types and frequency of crimes committed. For federal reports, see https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-publications, and for a summary of crimes committed at different levels, see www.bjs.gov.\n\nYou can also identify specialized software used with certain crimes. For example, if you find a check-writing software tool used in several counterfeiting cases, you should consider adding this specialized software to your inventory.\n\nIf you’re preparing to set up a forensics lab for a private company, you can determine your needs more easily because you’re working in a contained environment. Start by getting an inventory of all known computing systems and applications used in the business. For example, an insurance company often has a network of Intel PCs and servers and specialized insurance software using a database for data storage. A large manufacturing company might use Intel PCs, UNIX workstations running a computer-aided design (CAD) system, super minicomputers, and mainframes. A publishing company might have a combination of Intel PCs and Macintosh systems and a variety of word processing, imaging, and composition packages. Many other organizations use cloud-based storage or supervisory control and data\n\npackages. Many other organizations use cloud-based storage or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for data and applications.\n\nNext, check with your Management, Human Resource, and Security departments to determine the types of complaints and problems reported in the past year. Most companies using Internet connections, for example, get complaints about employees accessing the Web excessively or for personal use, which generate investigations of Web misuse. Be sure to distinguish investigations of excessive Web use from inappropriate Web site access and e-mail harassment.\n\nYour budget should also take future developments in digital technology into account because drive storage capabilities improve constantly. When examining a disk, you need a target disk to copy evidence data to. This disk should be at least one and a half times the size of the evidence (suspect) disk. For example, a lab equipped with 4 TB disks can effectively analyze disks up to 3 TB. If your company upgrades its computers to 3 TB disks, however, you need disks that are 6 TB or more or a central secure server with at least 100 TB or more of storage. One forensic server, the Digital Intelligence FREDC (www.digitalintelligence.com/products/fredc/), includes a private cloud that starts at 96 TB, with options for installing more storage. Many businesses replace their desktop computers every 18\n\nwith options for installing more storage. Many businesses replace their desktop computers every 18 months to three years. You must be informed of computer upgrades and other changes in the computing environment so that you can prepare and submit your budget for needed resources.\n\nWhen considering a central forensic server, such as the FREDC, your network should be designed to support higher speeds. The faster the network, the faster data can be transferred to and from the forensic server and workstations. This increase in speed reduces the time needed to process cases.\n\nAn alternative to digital forensics data storage is cloud storage. The cost savings are considerably higher than you get when purchasing storage hardware; however, you need to consider the throughput speeds of retrieving data and the levels of security. For more information on cloud security, see the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security as a Service (SecaaS) Working Group (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/group/security-as-a-service/#_downloads), which offers several papers and implementation guides.\n\nLike hardware, OSs change periodically. If your current digital forensics tool doesn’t work with the next release of an OS or a file system, you must upgrade your software tools. You should also monitor or contact vendor product development teams to learn about upgrades. File systems change, too. Forensics tools had their birth in DOS, and over the years, Windows hard disks used a variety of file systems, including FAT16, FAT32, New Technology File System (NTFS), Resilient File System (ReFS), and others. Most DOS-based tools can’t read NTFS disks. In addition, the popularity and prevalence of the Xbox requires investigators to be familiar with the FATX file system.\n\nTime management is a major factor when choosing software and hardware to purchase. For example, you’ve decided to purchase eight machines for your lab. Many commercial forensics software packages require a USB dongle to operate or have a site license of five concurrent users. You or the budget manager must decide whether you’re using all the machines or need only two licensed copies of each software package. Your choices depend on what tools you have verified and what’s needed for your casework.\n\nAnother option for viewing file systems is to use a Linux Live CD or WinFE (modified version of WinPE, the automated installation kit), which are CD or DVD disk acquisition tools discussed in Chapter 3. These tools don’t mount the hard drive automatically and, therefore, don’t write to the drive. (A hardware write-blocker is still recommended to prevent errors caused by the forensics technician, if nothing else.) Examining tablets, USB drives, and smartphones is routine now in cases from criminal investigations to civil litigation discovery demands. Digital investigators must be prepared to deal with constant change in these devices and know what tools are available to extract data from them safely for an investigation. In Chapter 12, you learn how to acquire data from these devices.",

The CFCE process changes as technology changes. The description here is current as of this writing. IACIS requires recertification every three years to demonstrate continuing work in the field of digital forensics. Recertification is less intense than the original certification but does test examiners to make sure they’re continuing their education and are still active in the field of digital forensics. For the latest information about the CFCE certification, or IACIS membership, visit the IACIS Web site.\n\nIn addition to the CFCE, IACIS has two specialized certification programs: Certified Advanced Windows Forensic Examiner (CAWFE) and the IACIS Certified Mobile Device Examiner (ICMDE).\n\nInternational Association of Computer Investigative Specialists\n\nThe International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS) provides a well-defined, simple guide for expected behavior of forensics examiners. These standards follow the principles defined by other professional organizations for investigations and testimony. The standards for IACIS members that apply to testifying include the following:\n\nMaintain the highest level of objectivity in all forensic examinations and accurately present the facts involved.\n\nExamine and analyze evidence in a case thoroughly.\n\nConduct examinations based on established, validated principles.\n\nRender opinions having a basis that is demonstratively reasonable.\n\nNot withhold any findings, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, that would cause the facts of a case to be misrepresented or distorted.\n\nNote\n\nFor more information on the IACIS code of ethics, see www.iacis.com/membership-2/membership-overview/.",

You shouldn’t use an open cubicle because it allows easy access to your evidence. You need a room you can lock to control your evidence and attest to its integrity. In particular, your lab should be secure during data analysis, even if it takes several weeks to analyze a disk drive. To preserve the integrity of evidence, your lab should function as an evidence locker or safe, making it a secure facility A facility that can be locked and allows limited access to the room’s contents. or a secure storage safe.\n\nThe following are the minimum requirements for a digital forensics lab of any size:\n\nSmall room with true floor-to-ceiling walls\n\nDoor access with a locking mechanism (limited to authorized users, including cleaning crews), which can be a regular key lock, combination lock, or an electronic lock capable of logging who accessed it\n\nSecure container, such as a safe or heavy-duty file cabinet with a quality padlock that prevents drawers from opening\n\nVisitor’s log with legible entries listing all people who have accessed the lab and showing the date, time in, and time out\n\nFor daily work production, several examiners can work together in a large open area, as long as they all have the same level of authority and access need. This area should also have floor-to-ceiling walls and a locking door. In many public and private organizations, several investigators share a door to the lab that requires an ID card and entry code.\n\nDigital investigators and forensics examiners must be briefed on the lab’s security policy.

                  "content": "Conducting High-Risk Investigations\n\nHigh-risk investigations, such as those involving national security or murder, demand more security than the minimum lab requirements provide. As technology improves and information circulates among computer attackers, keeping an investigation secure can be more difficult. For example, detecting computer eavesdropping is difficult and expensive, but sophisticated criminals and intelligence services in foreign countries can use equipment that detects network transmissions, wireless devices, phone conversations, and the use of computer equipment. Instructions for building a sniffing device that can collect computer emanations illegally can be found online and, therefore, are available to anyone. These devices can pick up anything you type on your computer.\n\nMost electronic devices emit electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Certain kinds of equipment can intercept EMR, which can be used to determine the data the device is transmitting or displaying. The EMR from a computer monitor can be picked up as far away as a half mile.\n\nDuring the Cold War, defense contractors were required to shield sensitive computing systems and prevent electronic eavesdropping of any computer emissions. The U.S. Department of Defense calls this special computer-emission shielding TEMPEST A term referring to facilities that have been hardened so that electrical signals from digital devices, computer networks, and telephone systems can’t be monitored or accessed easily by someone outside the facility. . (For a brief description of TEMPEST, see the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual [NISPOM]. DoD 5220.22-M, Chapter 11, Section 1, TEMPEST, www.dss.mil/documents/odaa/nispom2006-5220.pdf or SANS Institute, InfoSec Reading Room’s article “An Introduction to TEMPEST,”\n\nor SANS Institute, InfoSec Reading Room’s article “An Introduction to TEMPEST,” www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/privacy/introduction-tempest-981. Another site listing reliable sources is www.jammed.com/~jwa/tempest.html.)\n\nTo protect your investigations, you might consider constructing a TEMPEST-qualified lab, which requires lining the walls, ceiling, floor, and doors with specially grounded conductive metal sheets. Typically, copper sheeting is used because it conducts electricity well. TEMPEST facilities must include special filters for electrical power that prevent power cables from transmitting computer emanations. All heating and ventilation ducts must have special baffles to trap emanations. Likewise, telephones inside the TEMPEST facility must have special line filters. A TEMPEST facility usually has two doors separated by dead space. The first exterior door must be shut before opening the interior door. Each door also has special copper molding to enhance electricity conduction.\n\nBecause a TEMPEST-qualified lab facility is expensive and requires routine inspection and testing, it should be considered only for large regional digital forensics labs that demand absolute security from illegal eavesdropping. To avoid these costs, some vendors have built low-emanating workstations instead of TEMPEST facilities. These workstations are more expensive than average workstations but less expensive than a TEMPEST lab.",

                  "content": "Using Evidence Containers\n\nEvidence storage containers, also known as evidence lockers, must be secure so that no unauthorized person can access your evidence easily. You must use high-quality locks, such as padlocks, with limited duplicate-key distribution. Also, inspect the contents of evidence storage containers routinely to make sure only current evidence is stored. The evidence custody forms should indicate what’s still in the locker. Evidence for closed cases should be moved to a secure off-site facility.\n\nChapter 5, Section 3, of the NISPOM (www.dss.mil/documents/odaa/nispom2006-5220.pdf) describes the characteristics of a safe storage container. Consult with facility management or legal counsel, such as corporate or prosecuting attorneys, to determine what your lab should do to maintain evidence integrity. The following are recommendations for securing storage containers:\n\nThe evidence container should be located in a restricted area that’s accessible only to lab personnel.\n\nThe number of people authorized to open the evidence container should be kept to a minimum. Maintain records on who’s authorized to access each container.\n\nAll evidence containers should remain locked when they aren’t under the direct supervision of an authorized person.\n\nIf a combination locking system is used for your evidence container, follow these practices:\n\nProvide the same level of security for the combination as for the container’s contents. Store the combination in another equally secure container.\n\nDestroy any previous combinations after setting up a new combination.\n\nAllow only authorized personnel to change lock combinations.\n\nChange the combination every six months, when any authorized personnel leave the organization, and immediately after finding an unsecured container—that is, one that’s open and unattended.\n\nIf you’re using a keyed padlock, follow these practices:\n\nAppoint a key custodian who’s responsible for distributing keys.\n\nStamp sequential numbers on each duplicate key.\n\nMaintain a registry listing which key is assigned to which authorized person.\n\nConduct a monthly audit to ensure that no authorized person has lost a key.\n\nTake an inventory of all keys when the custodian changes.\n\nPlace keys in a lockable container accessible only to the lab manager and designated key custodian.\n\nMaintain the same level of security for keys as for evidence containers.\n\nChange locks and keys annually; if a key is missing, replace all associated locks and the key.\n\nDo not use a master key for several locks.\n\nThe storage container or cabinet should be made of steel and include an internal cabinet lock or external padlock. If possible, purchase a safe, which provides superior security and protects your evidence from fire damage. Look for specialized safes, called “media safes,” designed to protect electronic media. Media safes are rated by the number of hours it takes before fire damages the contents. The higher the rating, the better the safe protects evidence.\n\nAn evidence storage room is also convenient, especially if it’s part of your forensics lab. Security for an evidence room must integrate the same construction and securing devices as the general lab does. Large digital forensics operations also need an evidence custodian and a service counter with a securable metal roll-up window to control evidence. With a secure evidence room, you can store large computer components, such as computers, monitors, and other peripheral devices.\n\nBe sure to maintain a log listing every time an evidence container is opened and closed. Each time the container is accessed, the log should indicate the date it was opened and the initials of the authorized person. These records should be maintained for at least three years or longer, as prescribed by your prosecuting or corporate attorneys. Logs are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.",

How much physical security you implement depends on the nature of your lab. A regional computer crime lab has high physical security needs because of the risks of losing, corrupting, or damaging evidence. The physical security needs of a large corporation are probably not as high because the risk of evidence loss or compromise is much lower. Determining the risk for your organization dictates how much security you integrate into your digital forensics lab.\n\nNote\n\nWhen considering digital security needs, many companies neglect physical security.\n\nRegardless of the security risk to your lab, maintain a paper or electronic sign-in log for all visitors. The log should list the visitor’s name, date and time of arrival and departure, employer’s name, purpose of the visit, and name of the lab member receiving the visitor. Consider anyone who’s not assigned to the lab to be a visitor, including cleaning crews, facility maintenance personnel, friends, and family. All visitors should be escorted by an assigned authorized staff member throughout their visit to the lab to ensure that they don’t accidentally or intentionally tamper with an investigation or evidence. As an added precaution, use a visible or audible alarm, such as a visitor badge, to let all investigators know that a visitor is in the area.

                  "content": "Determining Floor Plans for Digital Forensics Labs\n\nHow you configure the work area for your digital forensics lab depends on your budget, the amount of available floor space, and the number of computers you assign to each computing investigator. For a small operation handling two or three cases a month, one forensic workstation should be enough to handle the workload. One workstation requires only the space an average desk takes up. If you’re handling many more cases per month, you can probably process two or three investigations at a time, which requires more than one workstation. The ideal configuration for multiple workstations is to have two forensic workstations plus one non-forensic workstation with Internet access.\n\nBecause you need plenty of room around each workstation, a work area containing three workstations requires approximately 150 square feet of space, meaning the work area should be about 10 feet by 15 feet. This amount of space allows for two chairs so that the digital investigator can brief another investigator, paralegal, or attorney on the case.\n\nSmall labs usually consist of one or two forensic workstations, a research computer with Internet access, a workbench (if space allows), and storage cabinets, as shown in Figure 2-2.\n\nMid-size digital forensics labs, such as those in a private business, have more workstations. For safety reasons, the lab should have at least two exits, as shown in Figure 2-3. If possible, cubicles or even separate offices should be part of the layout to reinforce the need-to-know policy. These labs usually have more library space for software and hardware storage.\n\nState law enforcement or the FBI usually runs most large or regional digital forensics labs. As shown in Figure 2-4, these labs have a separate evidence room, which is typical in police investigations, except this room is limited to digital evidence. One or more custodians might be assigned to manage and control traffic in and out of the evidence room.\n\nAs discussed, the evidence room needs to be secure. The lab should have at least two controlled exits and no windows. Separate offices for supervisors and cubicles for investigators are more practical in this configuration. Remember that forensic workstations are connected to an isolated local area network (LAN), and only a few machines are connected to an organization’s intranet or the Internet.",

For small, local police departments, however, most work involves Windows PCs, Macintosh systems, and mobile devices. A small police department’s digital forensics lab could be limited to one multipurpose forensic workstation with one or two basic workstations or high-end laptops.\n\nOne way to investigate older and unusual computing systems is to keep track of forums and blogs that you can find through an online search. These groups can be a valuable source of support for recovering and analyzing uncommon systems. Entering “computer forensics” or “digital forensics” as a search keyword produces several links you can follow to further your knowledge in this profession. You can also coordinate with or subcontract to larger forensics labs. Like large police departments, a regional digital forensics lab must have diverse systems to serve its community and often receives work from smaller labs involving unusual computers or OSs.\n\nComputing systems in a lab should be able to process typical cases in a timely manner. The time it takes to process a case usually depends on the size and type of industries in the region. For example, suppose your lab is located in a region with a large manufacturing firm that employs 50,000 people. Based on crime reports you’ve consulted, 1% of those employees might be involved in criminal behavior, meaning 500 employees will commit crimes such as fraud, embezzlement, and so on. These statistics can help you estimate how much time is involved in processing these types of cases.\n\nImprovements in hardware technology offer more flexibility in digital forensics. You can now use a laptop system with USB 3.0 or SATA hard disks to create a lightweight, mobile forensic workstation. Improved throughput speeds of data transfer on laptops also make it easier to create images of suspect drives, especially in the field.\n\nAnother consideration is the need to perform password cracking to access a suspect’s encrypted data. For this task, desktop computers that can use multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) are helpful. For the latest information on password recovery, search online for “password cracking systems and clusters.”\n\nFor white papers about password clusters, consult the following resources:\n\nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.70.2420&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\nwww.emc.com/collateral/software/white-papers/h5936-recoverpoint-cluster-enabler-wp.pdf\n\nwww.whitehatsec.com/blog/cracking-aes-256-dmgs-and-epic-self-pwnage/\n\nwww.picocomputing.com/pdf/Pico_White_Paper_Crypto_Nov_09.pdf\n\nwww.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Morris-CrackLord-Maximizing-Password-Cracking-wp.pdf",

They can specialize in one or two platforms, such as an Intel PC running a Microsoft OS. They can also gather a variety of tools to meet a wider market. The type of equipment they need depends on their specialty, if any. For general digital forensics facilities, a multipurpose forensic workstation is enough.\n\nPrivate companies conducting their own internal digital investigations can determine the type of forensic workstation they need based on the types of computers they use. If a company uses only Windows PCs, internal investigators don’t need a wide variety of specialized equipment. If a company uses many kinds of computers, its internal investigators need systems and equipment that support the same types of computers. With some digital forensics programs, you can work from a Windows PC and examine both Windows and Macintosh disk drives."

A disaster recovery plan ensures that you can restore your workstations and file servers to their original condition or a lab-like building if a catastrophic failure occurs.\n\nA disaster recovery plan also specifies how to rebuild a forensic workstation after it has been severely contaminated by a virus from a drive you’re analyzing. Central to any disaster recovery plan is a system for backing up investigation computers. Tools such as Norton Ghost are useful for restoring files directly. As a general precaution, you should back up your workstation once a week. You can restore programs from the original disks, USB drives, CDs/DVDs, or the cloud, but recovering lost data without up-to-date backups is difficult.\n\nStore your system backups where they are easily accessible. You should have at least one copy of backups on site and a duplicate or a previous copy of backups stored in a safe off-site facility. Off-site backups are usually rotated on a schedule that varies according to your needs, such as every day, week, or month.\n\nIn addition, record all updates you make to your workstation by using a process called configuration management The process of keeping track of all upgrades and patches you apply to your computer’s OS and applications. . Some companies log updates in a configuration management database to maintain compliance with lab policy. Every time you add or update software on your workstation, enter the change in the database or in a simple notebook with handwritten entries to document the change. A useful tool to run regularly is Belarc Advisor (www.belarc.com/free_download.html), which inventories applications, hardware, and system configurations.\n\nA disaster recovery plan can also address how to restore a workstation you reconfigured for a specific investigation. For example, if you install a suite of applications, you might not have enough disk space for normal processing needs, so you could encounter problems during reconfigurations or even simple upgrades. The disaster recovery plan should outline how to uninstall software and delete any files the uninstall program hasn’t removed so that you can restore your system to its original configuration.\n\nFor labs using high-end RAID servers or a private cloud (such as a Dell PowerEdge or Digital Intelligence FREDC), you need methods for restoring large data sets. These servers must have adequate data backup systems in case of a major failure of more than one drive. When planning a recovery procedure for RAID servers, consider whether the amount of downtime it takes to restore backup data is acceptable to the lab operation.",

Depending on how large the lab is, you must determine first how much floor space is needed. As mentioned, a good rule of thumb is 150 square feet per person. This amount of space might seem a bit larger than necessary, but you need to factor in how much storage space is needed to preserve evidence and to have enough supplies in stock. Check with your organization’s facility manager on per-square-foot costs for your area or building. Here are some sample questions to get you started on calculating a budget:\n\nHow many digital forensics examiners do you need?\n\nHow much training does each examiner require per year, and what are the estimated costs?\n\nDo you need more than one lab?\n\nHow many digital forensics examiners are going to use each lab? Is there a need to accommodate other nonexaminers temporarily to inspect recovered evidence?\n\nWhat are the costs to construct a secure lab?\n\nIs there a suitable room that can be converted into a lab?\n\nDoes the designated room have enough electrical power and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems?\n\nDoes the designated room have existing phone lines and network cables? If not, how much would it cost to install these items?\n\nIs there an adequate lock on the designated room’s door?\n\nWhat are the furniture costs?\n\nDo you need to install an alarm system?\n\nAre there any other facility costs, such as fees for janitorial services and facility maintenance services?\n\nIf IT support is needed, how many hours of support are estimated?",

                      "content": "Hardware Requirements\n\nDetermining the types of investigations and data that will be analyzed in your forensics lab dictates what hardware equipment you need. If your organization is using Intel-based PCs with Windows 10 or later, for instance, your forensic workstation should be a high-end Intel-based PC, too. For a small police department, determining the types of computers the public uses is more difficult. The diversity of a community’s computer systems requires a police department to be more versatile in the tools needed to conduct investigations. To determine hardware budget needs, here are some questions to consider in your planning:\n\nWhat types of investigations and data recovery will be performed in the lab?\n\nHow many investigations can be expected per month of operation?\n\nAre there any time-sensitive investigations that demand rapid analysis of disk data?\n\nHow many drives (and what sizes) are needed to support a typical investigation?\n\nDo you need a high-speed backup system, such as tape backup or DVD burners?\n\nWhat’s the predominant type of computer system you will investigate?\n\nWhat will you use to store digital evidence? How long do you need to store it?\n\nHardware Requirements\n\nUse a standard installation of Windows 10. The computer running Windows should be a fairly current model that meets the following minimum requirements:\n\nUSB ports\n\nCD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive\n\nVGA or higher monitor\n\nHard disk partition of 500 GB or more\n\nMouse or other pointing device\n\nKeyboard\n\nAt least 6 GB RAM (more recommended)\n\nFor labs done in Linux, it’s assumed you’re using an Ubuntu 16.04 or later standard installation, although other Linux distributions will work with minor modifications. Some labs use specialized “live” Linux distributions, such as Kali Linux. The hardware requirements are as follows:\n\nA DVD or a USB drive of 6 GB or more\n\nOther hardware requirements are the same as those listed for Windows computers",

                      "content": "Software Requirements\n\nIn the past few years, many more digital forensics tools have become available. For the private sector, the cost for these tools is about $1100 and up. For the public sector, many forensics software vendors offer discounts. However, just as you select hardware for your digital forensics lab to fit specific needs, you must determine what type of OSs and applications will be investigated and then make purchases accordingly. Keep in mind that the more you spend on a forensics software package, the more function and flexibility you’ll have. To determine software budget needs, here are some questions to consider in your planning:\n\nWhat types of OSs will be examined?\n\nFor less popular, uncommon, or older OSs (such as Mac OS 9.x, OS/2, and CP/M), how often is there a need to investigate them?\n\nWhat are the minimum needs for forensics software tools? For example, how many copies of each tool are needed? How often is each tool used in an average week?\n\nWhat types of OSs are needed to conduct routine examinations?\n\nIs there a need for specialized software, such as QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Xero, or Sage 50c?\n\nIs there a budget to purchase more than one forensics software tool?\n\nWhich disk-editing tool should be selected for general data analysis?\n\nSoftware Requirements\n\nThe following is a list of the freeware, shareware, and demo software used in this lab manual:\n\nNote\n\nAlthough efforts have been made to supply information that’s current at the time of writing, Web site addresses change often, so search online to find the following software if URLs are no longer valid. Demoware tools typically have limited functions and strict time limits on their use.

If you aren’t purchasing its license or are planning to do the labs at home, it’s recommended that you wait until Chapter 8 or later to begin using this tool so that your trial doesn’t expire before you finish the projects.\n\nClassroom Setup Guidelines\n\nThis lab manual assumes Windows has been installed and doesn’t require computers to be networked unless shared resources (such as printers), ExamView exams, or Internet access are needed. Lab managers can install the software in the preceding list ahead of time, if needed. As mentioned, some tools have time limits on their use, so plan lab assignments to make sure they can be done before licenses expire. Several labs use very large forensic images from 2 to 8 GB, and processing them might take up to 6 hours, depending on computer performance. Starting these labs before the end of the class day and allowing them to run overnight is the recommended method.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBill Nelson has worked for more than 32 years for two global Fortune 100 companies in information technologies, with more than 20 years in corporate digital forensics and information security.

It’s your responsibility to create a business case with a budget to present to upper management for approval. As part of the approval process, you should include a risk analysis describing how the lab will minimize the risk of litigation, which is a persuasive argument for supporting the lab. You also need to make an educated guess of how many investigations are anticipated and how long they will take on average. Remember that part of the approval process requires using negotiation skills to justify the business case. You might need to revise your case to get approval.\n\nAs part of the business case, acquisition planning requires researching different products to determine which one is the best and most cost effective. You need to contact several vendors’ sales staff and design engineers to learn more about each product and service. Another factor to investigate is annual maintenance costs. You need to budget for this expense, too, so that you can get support if you run into problems during an investigation. An additional item to research from others in the profession is the vendor’s maintenance history. Do other forensics labs use the same product, and have they had any problems getting support for problems they encounter?\n\nAnother consideration is vendors’ pricing structures. Vendor pricing isn’t based on the cost of creating CDs and DVDs and packaging them. Product prices are based on cost for development, testing, documentation support, shipping, and research and development for future improvements. In addition, vendors are for-profit organizations; they have investors to pay, too. Keep in mind that for vendors to be around next year to provide products and services for you, they need to make money."

              "content": "Building a Business Case for Developing a Forensics Lab\n\nBefore you can set up a digital forensics lab, you must enlist the support of managers and other team members. To do so, you build a business case A document that provides justification to upper management or a lender for purchasing new equipment, software, or other tools when upgrading your facility. , a plan you can use to sell your services to management or clients. In the business case, you justify acquiring newer and better resources to investigate digital forensics cases.\n\nHow you develop a business case depends on the organization you support. If you’re the sole proprietor, creating a business case is fairly simple. If you need money to buy tools, you can save your money for the purchase or negotiate with your bank for a loan. For a public entity such as a police department, business requirements can change drastically because budgets are planned a year or more in advance. Public agency department managers present their budget proposals to upper management. If the proposal is approved, upper management makes money available to acquire resources outlined in the budget. Some public organizations might have other funds available that can be spent immediately for special needs. Managers can divert these funds for emergency or unforeseen needs.\n\nNote\n\nLike private-sector companies, police departments usually have to justify expenses to upper management. The important difference is that police departments don’t always have to show cost recovery for the additional capabilities new resources and equipment offer.\n\nKeep in mind that a private-sector business, especially a large corporation, is motivated by the need to make money. A business case should demonstrate how digital investigations could save money and avoid risks that can damage profits, such as by preventing litigation involving the company. For example, court decisions have defined viewing pornographic images in the workplace as creating a hostile environment for other employees, which is related to employee harassment and computer misuse. An employer is responsible for preventing and investigating harassment of employees and nonemployees associated with the workplace. A company is also liable if it doesn’t actively prevent creating a hostile workplace by providing employee training and investigating allegations of computer misuse. A\n\nworkplace by providing employee training and investigating allegations of computer misuse. A lawsuit, regardless of who wins, can cost an employer several hundred thousand dollars. In your business case, compare the cost of training and conducting digital investigations with the cost of a lawsuit.\n\nThe Internet makes it difficult for employers to provide a safe and secure environment for employees. In particular, employees can misuse free Web-based e-mail services. These free services give senders anonymity, making it possible for employees to send inappropriate e-mails, often in the form of sexual harassment. Because training rarely prevents this type of behavior, an employer needs to institute an investigation program that involves collecting network logs, such as proxy server logs, and examining computer disks to locate traces of message evidence. Chapter 11 discusses e-mail abuse and using e-mail server and network logs.\n\nYour business case should also show how digital investigations can improve profits, such as by protecting intellectual property, trade secrets, and future business plans. For example, when employees leave one company for a competing company, they can reveal vital competitive information to their new employers. Suppose a company called Skateboard International (SI) has invested research and development funds into a new product that improves the stability of skateboards. Its main competitor is Better Skateboard; this company contacts Gwen Smith, a disgruntled SI employee, via e-mail and offers her a job. When Gwen leaves SI, she takes with her the plans for the new product. A few months later, Better Skateboard introduces a product similar to the skateboard Gwen had been researching at SI.\n\nBetter Skateboard introduces a product similar to the skateboard Gwen had been researching at SI. SI recognizes that the new, improved skateboard is similar to the one Gwen had been developing and consults the noncompete agreement Gwen signed when she was hired. SI thinks that Better Skateboard might have gotten its new product from Gwen and suspects that Better Skateboard stole its trade secret and intellectual property.\n\nSI could sue Better Skateboard and demand discovery on internal documents. Because Gwen and Better Skateboard corresponded via e-mail, a digital investigator needs to find data related to hiring and research engineering at Better Skateboard. Better Skateboard can also demand discovery on SI’s research records to determine whether any discrepancies in product design could disprove the lawsuit. In this example, digital investigations can allow one company to generate revenue from a new product and prevent the other company from doing so. Information related to profit and loss makes a persuasive argument in a business case.",
