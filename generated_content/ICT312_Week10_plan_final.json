                  "content": "Mobile Phone Basics\n\nMobile phone technology has advanced rapidly in the past few decades and developed far beyond what its inventors could have imagined. Gone are the days of two-pound cell phones that only the wealthy could afford. By the end of 2008, mobile phones had gone through three generations: analog, digital personal communications service (PCS), and third-generation (3G) The preceding generation of mobile phone standards and technology; had more advanced features and faster data rates than the older analog and personal communications service (PCS) technologies. . 3G introduced unheard-of capabilities, such as being able to download while you were walking or in a moving vehicle. Sprint Nextel introduced the fourth-generation (4G) The current generation of mobile phone standards, with technologies\n\nthe fourth-generation (4G) The current generation of mobile phone standards, with technologies that improved speed and accuracy. network in 2009. Several technologies can be used for 4G networks and are discussed later in this section. Fifth-generation (5G) The coming generation of mobile device standards, expected to be finalized in 2020. cellular networks, expected to be finalized in 2020, will incorporate emerging technologies, including the ever-expanding cloud and device-to-device networks.\n\nMany digital networks are used in the mobile phone industry, and Table 12-1 lists the main ones. Much of this table is taken from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) document “Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics” (Special Publication [SP] 800-101, Revision 1, May 2014; http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-101r1.pdf). You can download this document to learn more.\n\nTable 12-1. Digital Networks\n\nDigital network Description Code Division Multiple Access\n(CDMA) Developed during World War II, this\ntechnology was patented by Qualcomm after the war. One of the most\ncommon digital networks, it uses the full radio frequency spectrum to\ndefine channels. In the United States, Sprint, U.S. Cellular, and\nVerizon, for example, use CDMA networks. Global System for Mobile Communications\n(GSM) Another common digital network, it’s\nused by AT&T and T-Mobile in the United States and is the standard\nin Europe and Asia. Time Division Multiple Access\n(TDMA) This digital network uses the technique\nof dividing a radio frequency into time slots; GSM networks use this\ntechnique. It also refers to a specific cellular network standard\ncovered by Interim Standard (IS) 136. Integrated Digital Enhanced Network\n\ncovered by Interim Standard (IS) 136. Integrated Digital Enhanced Network\n(iDEN) This Motorola protocol combines several\nservices, including data transmission, into one network. Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service\n(D-AMPS) This network is a digital version of the\noriginal analog standard for cell phones. Enhanced Data GSM Environment\n(EDGE) This digital network, a faster version\nof GSM, is designed to deliver data. Orthogonal Frequency Division\nMultiplexing (OFDM) This technology for 4G networks uses\nenergy more efficiently than 3G networks and is more immune to\ninterference.\n\nMost Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) A widely used digital cell phone technology that makes use of spread-spectrum modulation to spread the signal across a wide range of frequencies. networks conform to IS-95, created by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) A U.S. trade association representing hundreds of telecommunications companies that works to establish and maintain telecommunications standards. . These systems are referred to as CDMAOne, and when they went to 3G services, they became CDMA2000.\n\nGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM) A second-generation cellular network standard; currently the most used cellular network in the world. uses the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) The technique of dividing a radio frequency into time slots, used by GSM networks; also refers to a cellular network standard covered by Interim Standard (IS) 136. See also Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). technique, in which multiple phones take turns sharing a channel on a round-robin basis. As noted in Table 12-1, TDMA also refers to the IS-136 standard, which introduced sleep mode to enhance battery life. TDMA can operate in the cell phone (800 to 1000 MHz) or personal communications service (PCS; 1900 MHz) frequency, so it’s compatible with several cell phone networks.\n\nThe 3G standard was developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) An international organization dedicated to creating telecommunications standards. under the United Nations. It’s compatible with CDMA, GSM, and TDMA. The Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) An improvement to GSM technology that enables it to deliver higher data rates. See also Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). standard was developed specifically for 3G.\n\nNote\n\nGSM carriers, by definition, must accept any GSM phone. CDMA carriers have locked phones and don’t have to accept any users who aren’t subscribers. Until recently, users who traveled frequently between the United States, Africa, Europe, and parts of Asia needed separate phones for each place. With GSM phones, you simply pop in a SIM card for the country you’re currently in.\n\nIn 2008, the International Telecommunication Union Radio (ITU-R) created the requirements for carriers to be considered 4G (www.whatsag.com/G/Understanding_4G.php). 4G networks can use the following technologies:\n\nOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing—The Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) A 4G technology that uses numerous parallel carriers instead of a single broad carrier and is less susceptible to interference. technology uses numerous parallel carriers instead of a single broad carrier and is less susceptible to interference (http://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/EE225C/Lectures/Lec16_ofdm.pdf).\n\nMobile WiMAX—This technology uses the IEEE 802.16e standard and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and supports transmission speeds of 12 Mbps. Sprint chose this technology for its 4G network, although some argue it’s not true 4G.\n\nUltra Mobile Broadband (UMB)—Also known as CDMA2000 EV-DO, this technology was used by CDMA network providers to switch to 4G and supports transmission speeds of 275 Mbps for downlinks and 75 Mbps for uplinks. It has been replaced by LTE (described later in this list).\n\nMultiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)—This technology, developed by Airgo and acquired by Qualcomm, supports transmission speeds of 312 Mbps and is used by 4G, WiMAX, and other technologies.\n\nLong Term Evolution (LTE)—This technology, designed for GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) technology, supports 45 Mbps to 144 Mbps transmission speeds. Commonly called “4G LTE.”\n\nTip\n\nAs an investigator, you should research these technologies to make sure you stay up to date.\n\nAlthough digital networks use different technologies, they operate on the same basic principles. Geographic areas are divided into cells resembling honeycombs. As described in NIST SP 800-101 (mentioned earlier in this section), three main components are used for communication with these cells:\n\nBase transceiver station (BTS)—This component is made up of radio transceiver equipment that defines cells and communicates with mobile phones; it’s sometimes referred to as a “cell phone tower,” although the tower is only one part of the BTS equipment.\n\nBase station controller (BSC)—This combination of hardware and software manages BTSs and assigns channels by connecting to the mobile switching center.\n\nMobile switching center (MSC)—This component connects calls by routing digital packets for the network and relies on a database to support subscribers. This central database contains account data, location data, and other key information needed during an investigation. If you have to retrieve information from a carrier’s central database, you usually need a warrant or subpoena."

They can also store other information, such as messages and call history. are usually found in GSM devices and consist of a microprocessor and internal memory. SIM cards are similar to standard memory cards, except the connectors are aligned differently. iPhones and many Android phones have micro SIM and nano SIM slots. However, some can be accessed only if the phone has been unlocked.\n\nGSM refers to mobile phones as “mobile stations” and divides a station into two parts: the SIM card and the mobile equipment (ME), which is the remainder of the phone.

Newer TDMA phones in North America do use SIM cards, however, and they are sealed so that users must contact the service provider when changing phones or providers.\n\nAs mentioned, many phones now include SD cards for external storage. Standard SD cards range from 16 GB to 64 GB and can be part of a mobile device or game console. Other sizes include miniSD and microSD cards.

The hardware consists of a microprocessor, ROM, RAM, a digital signal processor, a radio module, a microphone and speaker, hardware interfaces (such as keypads, cameras, and GPS devices), and an LCD display. Many have removable memory cards and up to 64 GB of internal memory, and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are included in most mobile devices (“Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics,” SP 800-101, Revision 1, May 2014; http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-101r1.pdf).\n\nMost basic phones have a proprietary OS, although smartphones use the same OSs as PCs (or stripped-down versions of them). These OSs include Windows Mobile, RIM OS, Android (based on Linux), Google OS, and iOS (for Apple devices). Typically, phones store system data in electronically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) A type of nonvolatile memory that can be reprogrammed electrically, without having to physically access or remove the chip. , which enables service providers to reprogram phones without having to access memory chips physically.

Acquiring data from ROM is covered in more detail later in “Understanding Acquisition Procedures for Mobile Devices.”\n\nFor personal use, personal digital assistants (PDAs) have been replaced by iPods, iPads, and other mobile devices. The use of PDAs has shifted to more specific markets, such as medical or industrial PDAs; they’re now called “handhelds” and are still sold on sites such as Amazon and eBay. Palm Pilot and Microsoft Pocket PC were popular models when PDAs came on the market in the 1990s. HP purchased Palm and used the OS in its early touchpads. Similar to smartphones, PDAs housed a microprocessor, flash ROM, RAM, and other hardware components. As with smartphones, the amount of information on a PDA varied depending on the model.

When you consider that smartphones have the same computing power as desktops of a few years ago, the amount of information stored on them is often enough to piece together a case’s facts. Top-of-the-line smartphones are even comparable to current mid-range computers (“Computer vs. Smartphone,” www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001398.htm). In many countries, phones are used to log in to bank accounts, make deposits, and transfer funds from one device to another, which provides even more potential evidence.\n\nNote\n\nThe use of smartphones for illicit activities—such as identity theft, child pornography, and bank fraud—has become more prevalent.\n\nBecause mobile devices are seized at the time of arrest, police used to look through them as a routine matter. The Supreme Courts of Oregon and Ohio, however, ruled that a search warrant is needed to examine these devices because of all the information they can contain. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Riley v. California that a search warrant is required before an arresting officer can begin examining a phone’s contents (www.newrepublic.com/article/118396/supreme-court-cellphone-case-went-further-privacy-advocates-hoped, June 2014).

Despite the usefulness of these devices in providing clues for investigations, investigating smartphones and other mobile devices is a challenging task in digital forensics. No single standard exists for how and where phones store messages, although many phones use similar storage schemes. In addition, new phones come out about every six months, and they’re rarely compatible with previous models. Therefore, the cables, software, and accessories used for forensics acquisitions can become obsolete in a short time."

In addition, biological agents, such as fingerprints, might be present on the inside of the case, so you should consult the lead investigator when you’re ready to proceed to this step. The general procedure is as follows:\n\nRemove the device’s back panel.\n\nRemove the battery.\n\nRemove the SIM card from its holder.\n\nInsert the SIM card into the card reader, which you insert into your forensic workstation’s USB port.\n\nA variety of SIM card readers are available. Some are forensically sound and some are not; make sure you note this feature in your investigation log. Another problem with SIM card readers is dealing with text and SMS messages that haven’t been read yet. After you view a message, the device shows the message as opened or read. For this reason, documenting messages that haven’t been read is critical. Using a tool that takes pictures of each screen can be valuable because these screen captures can provide additional documentation."

With Android devices, the process can be as simple as using AccessData FTK Imager to perform a logical acquisition and a low-level analysis (“How Avast recovered ‘erased’ data from used Android phones,” July 2014, http://blog.avast.com/2014/07/09/android-foreniscs-pt-2-how-we-recovered-erased-data/).\n\niPhone acquisition procedures are similar, and several good tools are available, such as MacLockPick 3.0 (http://macforensicslab.com/product/maclockpick/), which is designed to deal with iPhones, iPads, iOS, and Mac OS X Lion (now macOS). It can also extract iPhoto information, handle plug-in apps, and pull the user’s online history.\n\nThe NIST guidelines (http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-101r1.pdf) list six types of mobile forensics methods:\n\nManual extraction—This method involves looking at the device’s content page by page and taking pictures. It’s used if investigators can’t do a logical or physical extraction.\n\nLogical extraction—The mobile device is connected to a forensic workstation via a wired (USB cable, for example) or wireless (such as Bluetooth) connection, and then the file system information is extracted.\n\nPhysical extraction—As with a logical extraction, the mobile device is attached to a forensic workstation. However, a forensic copy is made so that deleted files can be retrieved and other items decoded.\n\nHex dumping and Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) extraction—Hex dumping involves using a modified boot loader to access the RAM for analysis (http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2008/09/03/hex-dumping-flash-from-a-mobile). The JTAG extraction method gets information from the processor, flash memory, or other physical components. It’s a highly invasive method.\n\nChip-off—This method requires physically removing flash memory chip and gathering information at the binary level.\n\nMicro read—This method looks at logic gates with an electron microscope and can be used even when data has been overwritten on magnetic media. It’s very expensive, however, so it’s typically used only in cases involving national security.\n\nParaben Software (www.paraben.com), a vendor of mobile forensics software, offers several tools, such as E3:DS, for mobile device investigations. It examines Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has a bootloader for locked mobile devices, and can perform data parsing and cloud data capture. Paraben offers different packages for a variety of uses. Another tool, DataPilot (www.datapilot.com), has a collection of cables that can interface with phones made by Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, Samsung, Audiovox, Sanyo, and others. Susteen Inc. (http://susteen.com) also has a tool for mobile forensics analysis called Secure View 3 (http://secureview.us).\n\nBitPim (www.bitpim.org) is a tool used to view data on many CDMA phones, including LG, Samsung, Sanyo, and others. It offers versions for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It’s not a forensics tool, but it can be used in read-only mode. In Windows, BitPim stores files in Documents\\BitPim by default, so when you start a new case, make sure you move these files to another location first so that they’re not overwritten (www.windowsuninstaller.org/winuninstall/how-to-remove-BitPim-1-0-7-guide-BitPim-1-0-7-uninstaller-info.html).\n\nCaution\n\nKeep in mind that you should validate any new tool and verify its claims with rigorous testing.\n\nCellebrite UFED Forensic System (www.cellebrite.com) works with smartphones, PDAs, tablets, and GPS devices. This kit comes with several hundred cables, includes handset support for phones from outside the United States, and handles multiple languages. The newer version can access a smart device via a USB cable. A lesser known tool used widely by government agencies is Micro Systemation XRY (www.msab.com), which retrieves data from smartphones, GPS devices, tablets, music players, and drones.\n\nMOBILedit Forensic (www.mobiledit.com) is a forensics software tool containing a built-in write-blocker. It can connect to phones directly via Bluetooth, irDA, or a cable and can read SIM cards by using a SIM reader. It’s notable for being very user friendly.\n\nSoftware tools differ in the information they display and the level of detail, and some tools are designed for updating files, not retrieving data. In general, tools designed to edit information, although they are user friendly, usually aren’t forensically sound. You might be able to view some data with one of these tools that you can’t view with a forensics tool, but note this step in your log and state that the tool isn’t typically used for forensics purposes. Every program has its idiosyncrasies, so be aware of the shortcomings of the tools you use, and document every step you take during an investigation."

What works today might not work on a model that comes out tomorrow. This section gives you an overview of procedures for working with mobile forensics software, and specific tools are discussed in the following sections.\n\nThe first step is identifying the mobile device. Most users don’t alter their devices, but some file off serial numbers, change the display to show misleading data, and so on. When attempting to identify a phone, you can make use of several online sources, such as www.phonescoop.com.\n\nNext, make sure you have installed the mobile device forensics software. As mentioned, not all facilities are equipped with the necessary software because many tools are cost prohibitive. Some vendors offer tools that simply take pictures of screens as you scroll through them. Forensically, this approach isn’t the best, but you can use it if no other alternatives are available.\n\nThe next step is to attach the phone to its power supply and connect the correct cables. Most phones now have a combination USB/power cable, and many are interchangeable. For older phones, often you have to rig cables together. Some vendors have toolkits with an array of cables you can use (discussed later in “Using Mobile Forensics Tools”).\n\nAfter you’ve connected the device, start the forensics software and begin downloading the available information. If your forensics software doesn’t support the model you’re investigating, you might need to acquire other tools. Your main concern should be that the software is forensically sound."

Cellebrite (www.cellebrite.com) includes UFED Reader, a mobile forensics tool that’s often used by law enforcement and the military. It also offers certifications with different training tracks. Its Universal Forensics Extraction Device (UFED) is a stand-alone portable device with software that can be loaded on a computer. This software has been tested on more than 19,000 devices. With this straightforward tool, you can determine a mobile device’s make and model, learn what has to be done before connecting a mobile device to the UFED device, and then retrieve the data. You have three options for data extraction: logical, file system, and\n\nand then retrieve the data. You have three options for data extraction: logical, file system, and physical. The logical extraction, however, doesn’t collect FaceBook, Snapchat, or other social media files, and the physical extraction requires some reconstruction of data. In Hands-On Project 12-5, you download UFED Reader and look at some physical and logical extractions.\n\nYou can also simply connect a mobile device to a computer to browse the file system and examine and retrieve files. Figure 12-2, for example, shows the file system on an Android device connected by USB cable to a computer. To make an acquisition, you just need a USB write-blocker. This method isn’t ideal, but you can use it to gather basic information.\n\nNote\n\nCreate a Work\\Chap12\\Chapter folder on your system. The work folder path shown in screenshots might differ slightly from yours.\n\nIn this activity, you see how to use the Magnet AXIOM demo software for mobile forensics:\n\nStart Magnet AXIOM Process, and click the CREATE NEW CASE button. In the Case number text box, type today’s date followed by a hyphen and the number of the case you’re working on that day, such as 02152018-1 for the first case of February 15, 2018. In the LOCATION FOR CASE FILES section, type Chapter in the Folder name text box. Click the BROWSE button next to the File path text box, navigate to and click your work folder, and click Select Folder. In the LOCATION FOR ACQUIRED EVIDENCE section, the folder name and file path should update automatically to be the same. If they don’t, type Chapter for the folder name and select the path as described previously. (Note: For an actual case, you might want to have the acquired evidence in a separate location.) Click the GO TO EVIDENCE SOURCES\n\nmight want to have the acquired evidence in a separate location.) Click the GO TO EVIDENCE SOURCES button.\n\nIn the SELECT EVIDENCE SOURCE section, you can choose COMPUTER, MOBILE, or CLOUD. Click the MOBILE icon. In the next window, you select which type of device you’re accessing: ANDROID, IOS, WINDOWS PHONE, KINDLE FIRE, or MEDIA DEVICE (MTP). In this case, click ANDROID. In the LOAD OR ACQUIRE window that opens automatically, click the ACQUIRE EVIDENCE icon, and then click NEXT. Finally, you specify whether the device is locked or unlocked. Click the Unlocked icon, and then click NEXT.\n\nThe SELECT DEVICE window displays a question mark to indicate an unknown device. Click NEXT.\n\nIn the GAIN ACCESS TO THE DEVICE window, click START. When prompted to disconnect the device from the computer, click Next in the PROGRESS list. Then you’re prompted to verify that the device is charged to at least 50% and is in airplane mode, as shown in Figure 12-3.\n\nThe program continues to prompt you through the remaining steps, such as setting up USB debugging and configuring developer options (see Figure 12-4). After it detects the device, as shown in Figure 12-5, click NEXT. Magnet AXIOM loads an agent (software) into RAM and starts accessing the mobile device.\n\nAfter Magnet AXIOM gains access to the device, you see a notification that the device is restarting, and you need to acknowledge access by the computer. If it gains privileged access, a physical acquisition is made; if not, a basic acquisition is made. After the acquisition is finished, Magnet AXIOM Examine starts. Exit the program after you’re verified that the acquisition data is in the location you specified in Step 1 for acquired evidence.\n\nMany mobile forensics tools are available, but most aren’t free. As the mobile forensics market continues to expand and mature, the methods and techniques for acquiring evidence will change.

              "content": "Understanding Acquisition Procedures for Mobile Devices\n\nSearch and seizure procedures for mobile devices are as important as procedures for computers. The main concerns are loss of power, synchronization with cloud services, and remote wiping. All mobile devices have volatile memory, so making sure they don’t lose power before you can retrieve RAM data is critical. At the investigation scene, determine whether the device is on or off. If it’s off, leave it off, but find the charger and attach it as soon as possible. Note this step in your log if you can’t determine whether the device was charged at the time of seizure. If the device is on, check the display for the battery’s current charge level.\n\nBecause mobile devices are often designed to synchronize with applications on a user’s laptop or tablet, any mobile device attached to a PC or tablet via a USB cable or micro USB cable should be disconnected immediately. Many people use their smartphones to get Internet access for tablets or laptops, so you might find these devices already connected to the Internet. Disconnecting them immediately helps prevent synchronization that might occur automatically on a preset schedule and overwrite data on the device. In addition, collect the laptop and any peripheral devices to determine whether the hard drive contains any information that’s been transferred and then deleted from the mobile device, including pictures, videos, and other files that have been transferred and then deleted.\n\nDepending on the warrant or subpoena, the time of seizure might be relevant. In addition, messages might be received on the mobile device after seizure that may or may not be admissible in court. If you determine that the device should be turned off to preserve battery power or prevent a possible attack, note the time and date when you take this step. The alternative is to isolate the device from incoming signals with one of the following options:\n\nPlace the device in airplane mode, if this feature is available.\n\nPlace the device in a paint can, preferably one that previously contained radio wave-blocking paint.\n\nUse a Faraday bag that conforms to Faraday wire cage standards. Many allow plugging a unit into a power source (http://faradaybag.com or www.disklabs.com/faraday-bags/).\n\nTurn the device off.\n\nThe drawback of using these isolating options is that the mobile device is put into roaming mode, which accelerates battery drainage. Most mobile devices shut themselves off or enter a “sleep state” after reaching a certain low battery level. In either case, a phone that’s been seized for investigation must be isolated from incoming signals and from broadcasting.\n\nCaution\n\nMake sure you handle all components with care and protect them from environmental factors and sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI).\n\nSANS DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) has a slightly different process that handles other possible problems (http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2014/06/24/getting-the-most-out-of-smartphone-forensic-exams-sans-advanced-smartphone-forensics-poster-release). It lists three conditions: The device is on and unlocked, the device is on and locked, and the device is off. If it’s on and unlocked, you must isolate it from the network, disable the screen lock, and remove the passcode, among other tasks. If the device is on and locked, what you can and can’t do varies depending on the type of device, such as whether it’s a BlackBerry, an iPhone, or an Android. If the device is off, you should attempt a physical static acquisition and then turn the device on, determine whether it’s\n\nshould attempt a physical static acquisition and then turn the device on, determine whether it’s locked, and then follow the procedure for either a locked or unlocked condition. As devices become more sophisticated, turning them off means removing the battery.\n\nWhen you’re back in the forensics lab, you need to assess what can be retrieved. To determine whether you should do a logical acquisition or physical acquisition, you need to know where information is stored. As with laptops and desktops, a logical acquisition involves accessing files and folders as you would see them when looking at them in File Explorer. A physical acquisition is a bit-by-bit acquisition done to find deleted files or folders. You should check the following locations for information, keeping in mind that with mobile devices, often you need manufacturers’ tools:\n\nInternal memory\n\nSIM card\n\nRemovable or external memory cards\n\nNetwork provider\n\nBecause of wiretap laws, checking providers’ servers requires a search warrant or subpoena, so you need one if you want to check voicemail stored by the provider or another third party, for example. In addition, because most newer phones and phone plans store voicemail on the phone, you need a search warrant for the device, too. You might also need information from the service provider to determine where the suspect or victim was at the time of a call, to access backups of contacts, and more. In the past, you had to serve the provider with a warrant to have a triangulation of a cell tower done to determine location. This is still true if you’re doing an ongoing investigation and don’t have the device. If, however, you have the device, you can usually retrieve GPS data from it.\n\nChecking with the service provider has been further complicated because backups might be stored in a cloud provided by the carrier or a third party. For iPods and iPads, syncing and backups tend to occur in the iCloud; other providers offer a similar cloud backup.\n\nGiven how crucial smartphones are now, people who lose them are concerned about the amount of sensitive information that can be gathered from them. Because of the growing problem of mobile devices being stolen, service providers have started using remote wiping to remove a user’s personal information stored on a stolen device, and this procedure often results in the loss of valuable information for investigations. Remote wiping is usually done to remove an account so that a thief can’t use the phone and rack up charges. It also erases all contacts, the calendar, and other personal information, such as photos and bank logins, stored on the device. In some instances, it restores the device to the original factory settings. Depending on the device and service provider, the device owner or the\n\noriginal factory settings. Depending on the device and service provider, the device owner or the service provider can do the remote wipe. Remote wiping can be used by device owners trying to protect their information.\n\nMemory storage on a mobile device is usually a combination of volatile and nonvolatile memory. Volatile memory requires power to maintain its contents, but nonvolatile memory doesn’t. Although the locations of data vary from one phone model to the next, volatile memory usually contains data that changes frequently, such as missed calls, text messages, and sometimes even user files. Nonvolatile memory, on the other hand, contains OS files and stored user data, such as a personal information manager (PIM) and backed-up files.\n\nAs mentioned, memory resides in the phone and in the SIM card, if the device is equipped with one. The file system for a SIM card is a hierarchical structure (see Figure 12-1). This file structure begins with the root of the system (MF). The next level consists of directory files (DF), and under them are files containing elementary data (EF). In this figure, the EFs under the GSM and DCS1800 DFs contain network data on different frequency bands of operation. The EFs under the Telecom DF contain service-related data.\n\nYou can retrieve quite a bit of data from a SIM card, depending on whether the phone is GSM or CDMA. The information that can be retrieved falls into four categories:\n\nService-related data, such as identifiers for the SIM card and subscriber\n\nCall data, such as numbers dialed\n\nMessage information\n\nLocation information\n\nIf power has been lost, you might need PINs or other access codes to view files. Typically, users keep the original PIN assigned to the SIM card, so when you’re collecting evidence at the scene, look for users’ manuals and other documentation that can help you access the SIM card. With most SIM cards, you have three attempts at entering an access code before the device is locked, which then requires calling the service provider to get the PIN unlock key (PUK) and waiting a certain amount of time before trying again. Common codes to try are 1-1-1-1 or 1-2-3-4."

They would be useful for security and protecting personal information but would add another layer of complexity to forensics investigations. In private-sector investigations, for example, you must take care to separate personal information from business-related data, and knowledge of privacy laws is especially crucial in this task. In the ensuing years, the idea of type 2 hypervisors for mobile devices has dropped by the wayside, but the issue of private or confidential data being on personal mobile devices still exists. Moreover, because bring your own device (BYOD) has become a business standard, investigators must consider how to keep employees’ personal data separate from case\n\nstandard, investigators must consider how to keep employees’ personal data separate from case evidence.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) brings additional challenges to the field of mobile forensics. The number of devices connecting to the Internet is higher than the number of people, and this number is expected to reach 50 billion in the next few decades (www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/). Although jokes about “The fridge did it” are rampant, the concerns are real.\n\nFrom a mobile device, you can turn on lights in your home, lock or unlock doors, adjust the thermostat, and more, and all these appliances and devices can be interconnected. LG offers a refrigerator that can order groceries for you, and it’s connected to an established payment method, such as a digital wallet. So in an investigation, determining who actually ordered food and unlocked the door when the delivery was made could be difficult. In the very near future, investigators will face these challenges and more.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the world has gone from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Internet of Everything (IoE) to the Internet of Anything (IoA). The IoT includes the ever-growing number of physical devices connected on the Internet. The article “Smart Forensics in the Internet of Things (IoT)” explains that the IoT covers not only wired, wireless, and mobile devices but also radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors (https://securityintelligence.com/smart-forensics-for-the-internet-of-things-iot/). The IoE adds features that aren’t tangible but are widespread on the Internet, such as the Google search engine and YouTube. The IoA includes cars, homes, pets, livestock, and applications for making all these things work together. The IoA makes people’s lives more convenient, but this\n\nfor making all these things work together. The IoA makes people’s lives more convenient, but this interconnectivity complicates tracking evidence.\n\nIn addition, the IoA will eventually include 5G smart devices, and 5G mobile networks are gaining momentum. In February 2017, the ITU began the final requirements for 5G networks with the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) working group, which is producing the document IMT-2020 (www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/2017-PR04.aspx). IMT-2020 will set the standards for 5G devices, which include smart homes, smart cars, smart cities, and more. Currently, the ITU has divided 5G into three categories:\n\nenhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB)—Provides more bandwidth to increase digital connectivity for users\n\nUltra-reliable and Low-latency Communications (uRLLC)—Focuses on devices such as self-driving cars\n\nmassive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)—Focuses on smart cities\n\nThese 5G devices introduce new challenges for digital forensics. Investigators will be dealing with people-to-device communications (P2D), device-to-device (D2D) communications, and device-to-cloud (D2C) communications. This variety of communication types complicates where they look for evidence. A recent demonstration on a news program showed a penetration tester breaking into a home’s wireless network via the television, and then starting the smart coffeemaker and turning off the owner’s laptop. If he had actually committed a crime, where would an investigator start to determine how he had gained access to the home’s network?\n\nYou can now turn on a burglar alarm in your home, turn on the lights, start the coffeemaker, and even start your car from your mobile device, whether it’s a smart phone or tablet. Smart refrigerators can order groceries for you and have them delivered and waiting in a cold storage box on your doorstep while you’re at work. In addition, smart cities are becoming more of a reality, with traffic lights controlled to keep traffic moving or stop traffic for emergency vehicles. The iOS watch can tell you that you’ve been sitting too long and need to take a walk or that your heartrate is too high and you need to do some deep breathing to calm down. This information can be synchronized with your smartphone and stored in the cloud. All these new developments expand the task of collecting evidence\n\nand stored in the cloud. All these new developments expand the task of collecting evidence for investigations.\n\nNote\n\nIn their paper “Digital Evidence Challenges in the Internet of Things,” Hegarty, Lamb, and Attwood emphasize that not all devices are created equal (Proceedings of the Ninth International Workshop on Digital Forensics and Incident Analysis, www.researchgate.net/publication/288660566_Digital_evidence_challenges_in_the_internet_of_things, 2014). Data from some devices might be reliable, but from other devices, it might not be. Also, the storage capacity on small devices might be limited, so data could be overwritten quickly.\n\nGaming consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Xbox are other devices that can contain information hackers might try to intercept and collect, and information on how to retrieve this information is readily available on the Internet. Because of the graphics-heavy software these consoles run, many are more powerful than standard desktop or laptop computers and, therefore, might be a target of attacks.\n\nResearch on wearable computers has been conducted at MIT labs for more than a decade, and these computers are now moving into working reality. For example, workers in warehouses can wear rings to scan inventory, and Google Glass is available to access the Internet or take pictures while walking, for example. As mentioned, the iOS Watch and other smartwatches are becoming popular. However, the iOS Watch synchronizes to a smartphone via a magnetic device. There’s no other way to get information from the watch, so this feature is one investigators must learn how to handle. In addition, IBM created a unique mobile phone as jewelry. Earrings are the speakers, a necklace is the microphone, a ring notifies you of incoming calls, and a bracelet identifies the caller\n\nis the microphone, a ring notifies you of incoming calls, and a bracelet identifies the caller (http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/home/digital-jewelry1.htm).

For example, your car can sense when another car is approaching perpendicular to your car as you back out or when your windshield wipers need to go faster.

The cloud has three basic service levels:\n\nSaaS— Software as a service (SaaS) With this cloud service level, typically a Web hosting service provides applications for subscribers to use. means applications are delivered via the Internet. A familiar one is Google Docs, which is similar to office suites such as Microsoft Office or LibreOffice. Data is stored in the cloud, and files can be accessed and shared with others.\n\nPaaS— Platform as a service (PaaS) A cloud is a service that provides a platform in the cloud that has only an OS. The customer can use the platform to load their own applications and data. The CSP is responsible only for the OS and hardware it runs on; the customer is responsible for everything else that they have loaded on to it. means an OS has been installed on a cloud server. Users can then install their own applications, settings, and tools in the cloud environment. The cloud provider maintains just the hardware for customers, who are responsible for their own system administration and application support.\n\nIaaS— Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) With this cloud service level, an organization supplies its own OS, applications, databases, and operations staff, and the cloud provider is responsible only for selling or leasing the hardware. means customers can rent hardware, such as servers and workstations, and install whatever OSs and applications they need. IaaS can come in handy when customers can’t afford to purchase hardware or pay someone to maintain it but can afford to rent. In addition, this service level makes it easy to add hardware during peak business periods, such as tax season or end-of-year accounting, and then cut back on hardware when it’s not needed during slow periods.\n\nNote\n\nNIST document 800-145 has only the three types of cloud services described in the preceding list. However, in June 2017, NIST document SP 500-322 was released for public comment and includes more than 75 services, such as backup as a service, security as a service, and Drupal as a service. The final document should be approved and released in the near future.\n\nTable 13-1 describes where investigators find evidence of cloud access, depending on the type of cloud service level.\n\nTable 13-1. Locations of evidence in different service levels\n\nService\nlevel Locations of\nevidence SaaS Most likely stored on a desktop, laptop,\ntablet, or smartphone. PaaS Most likely found on a desktop or\nserver, although it could also be stored on a company network or the\nremote service provider’s infrastructure. IaaS Usually found on a desktop or server;\ninfrastructure equipment can be owned by the company or the remote\nservice provider.\n\nFor investigators, the location of evidence affects what you can get access to and what laws regulate your actions. If, for example, you’re conducting a private-sector investigation and policies and procedures are in place, you can do a static acquisition of the device that accessed cloud data and a remote acquisition of files on the cloud server. If the organization has its own cloud server, the acquisition might be even more straightforward, particularly if the cloud server has built-in forensics and e-discovery tools. These tools speed up an investigation and reduce its costs. Having a forensics team or an incident response team with a digital forensics component in place is also important.\n\nThe deployment methods for a cloud are public, private, community, and hybrid. A public cloud A cloud service that’s available to the general public. is accessible to anyone, and typically, the only identification required is an e-mail address. This deployment method offers no security, but it’s popular because of its ease of use. Next is a private cloud A cloud service dedicated to a single organization. , which can be accessed only by people who have the necessary credentials, such as logon names and passwords; sometimes location is used as a way to restrict access, too. Most companies have private clouds. A community cloud A shared cloud service that provides access to common or shared data. is a way to bring people together for a specific purpose. For example, say a city wants all\n\ndata. is a way to bring people together for a specific purpose. For example, say a city wants all small businesses to have access to the same documents and templates. By creating a community cloud, the city can make these files accessible to those who have a current business license. A hybrid cloud A cloud deployment model that combines public, private, or community cloud services under one cloud. Segregation of data is used to protect private cloud storage and applications. enables a company to keep some information private and designate other files as public or community information."

Cloud forensics can be defined as simply as applying digital forensics to cloud computing and is considered a subset of network forensics (Keyun Ruan et al, “Cloud forensics: An overview,” www.researchgate.net/publication/229021339_Cloud_forensics_An_overview, 2011). This article describes cloud forensics as having three dimensions: organizational, legal, and technical. The organizational dimension\n\nas having three dimensions: organizational, legal, and technical. The organizational dimension addresses the structure of the cloud, such as location of data storage and administration of services. The legal dimension covers service agreements and other jurisdictional matters because a cloud’s data storage can be located anywhere in the world and even cross nations’ boundaries. The technical dimension deals with procedures and specialized applications designed to perform forensics recovery and analysis in the cloud. The following are capabilities forensics tools should have to handle acquiring data from a cloud:\n\nForensic data collection—Tools must be able to identify, label, record, and acquire data from the cloud.\n\nElastic, static, and live forensics—To meet the elastic nature of clouds, tools must be able to expand and contract their data storage capabilities as the demand for services changes.\n\nEvidence segregation—Clouds are set up for multitenancy A principle of software architecture in which a single installation of a program runs on a server accessed by multiple entities (tenants). When software is accessed by tenants in multiple jurisdictions, conflicts in copyright and licensing laws might result. , meaning many different unrelated businesses and users share the same applications and storage space, so forensics tools must be able to separate each customer’s data.\n\nInvestigations in virtualized environments—Because cloud operations typically run in a virtual environment, forensics tools should have the capability to examine virtual systems.\n\nAlthough most cloud architecture is composed of virtual machines, the actual cloud is much more complex. The failover capability is necessary in case a VM fails, and there are virtualized switches and routers along with multi-tenant and multi-cloud environments. Becoming proficient as a cloud manager on platforms such as vSphere takes a few years of experience maintaining these systems."

In their paper “Cloud Forensics Issues and Opportunities” (www.researchgate.net/publication/276010807_Cloud_Forensics_Issues_and_Opportunities, 2013), Aminnezhad et al conclude that global standards for cloud security and cloud forensics are necessary to ensure that data can move across borders and be accepted in courts.\n\nOften simply figuring out what law controls data stored in the cloud is a challenge. Although the CSA or associated contracts and addenda can prescribe what laws are enforceable, they don’t usually control privacy issues and criminal or civil procedures. (An addendum is used to add or change a contract without having to re-create it.) Many countries with legal systems derived from a common source, such as English common law, might have similar laws but vary in procedures. In addition, how privacy rights are defined in different jurisdictions is a major factor in problems with the right to access data. For example, EU Directive 95/46/EC (http://searchsecurity.techtarget.co.uk/definition/EU-Data-Protection-Directive) is more restrictive than rules in other countries, including the United\n\nis more restrictive than rules in other countries, including the United States. This directive protects private information for all EU citizens, stating that EU citizens must be notified before their personal information is accessed, and this information can be accessed only with their consent. Updates to the EU Data Protection Rules are being made, with member countries expected to incorporate them by May 2018. These updates are of particular interest because they will affect transfer of data outside the EU, which will require that companies and organizations meet EU data protection standards (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/index_en.htm, 2017).\n\nSome problems are as fundamental as establishing definitions of terms and roles and determining which law is applicable. As mentioned, when data is stored in multiple countries, conflicts in laws can happen. For this reason, digital forensics examiners could be held liable when conducting an investigation involving cloud data. Consult with legal experts when conducting cloud examinations to make sure you’re aware of possible restrictions in collecting evidence."

There has been a lot of litigation over the concept of “probable cause,” but not much case law applies to searches conducted in the cloud.\n\nNote\n\nTo get a search warrant, a government entity must show that there’s probable cause to believe the contents of a wire communication, an electronic communication, or other records are relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nThe law requires search warrants to contain specific descriptions of what’s to be seized. For cloud environments, the property to be seized usually describes data rather than physical hardware, unless the CSP is a suspect. Generally, however, seizing hardware yields no benefit that seizing just data can’t provide.\n\nSeizing hardware can also be disruptive to other customers sharing it with the suspect. For example, FBI agents seized computers from a data center in Dallas, Texas, to gather evidence in an investigation of two men accused of defrauding telecommunication providers. Seizing these computers had the unintended consequence of disrupting the business operations of around 50 companies with data hosted on these systems. The FBI’s main motivation in seizing these computers was that the CSP was also a suspect. As a result, however, Liquid Motors, a company providing inventory management services to car dealers, had to shut down its operations and filed a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the FBI the same day to get its data back. Although the TRO was denied, the FBI made mirror images of\n\nFBI the same day to get its data back. Although the TRO was denied, the FBI made mirror images of the data over the weekend to give to Liquid Motors (Liquid Motors, Inc. v. Lynd, No. 3:09-cv0611-N, N.D. Tex, April 3, 2009).\n\nSearch warrants must also describe the location of items to be seized. This step is straightforward when describing physical locations, but it’s less clear when dealing with online data because servers are often dispersed across state or national borders. The near-instant provisioning Allocating cloud resources, such as additional disk space. and deprovisioning Deallocating cloud resources that were assigned to a user or an organization.

(failing to preserve evidence) increases if the search is announced. The FBI faced this risk in the Liquid Motors case, which is why hardware was seized along with the data.\n\nFinally, a search warrant must establish how it will be carried out. Safeguards in federal search warrants include specifying the date and time of day to minimize disruptions to people and business operations."

This type of subpoena is used to get information when it’s believed there’s a danger of death or serious physical injury or to get information for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. U.S. federal courts interpret this as meaning that no Stored Communications Act provision permits disclosure for a civil discovery order unless the order comes from a government entity: “Subpoena may not be enforced consistent with the plain language of the Privacy Act because the exceptions enumerated in § 2702(b) do not include civil discovery subpoenas.” Most courts have concluded that\n\nenumerated in § 2702(b) do not include civil discovery subpoenas.” Most courts have concluded that third parties can’t be compelled to disclose electronic communications pursuant to a civil discovery subpoena (Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc., 717 F. Supp. 2d 965 [C.D. Cal. 2010], and Mintz v. Mark Bartelstein & Associates, Inc., 885 F. Supp. 2d 987, 991 [C.D. Cal. 2012]). The SCA doesn’t contain an exception for civil discovery subpoenas. See www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2702 for more information about this statute.\n\nNon-government and civil litigation subpoenas—These subpoenas are used to produce information from private parties for litigation. An example of how they apply to a CSP can be seen in Flagg v. City of Detroit (252 F.R.D. 346, E.D. Mich., 2008). A CSP received a civil subpoena for the production of electronically stored information (ESI) in the cloud, including text messages sent or received by city employees who used mobile devices supplied by SkyTel. Although the court determined that this data could be subject to discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it denied the subpoena because the evidence could have been acquired more easily by making an ESI discovery request to the cloud users.

Under U.S. Code 18, court orders are available only to government agencies. In U.S. federal courts, it’s interpreted as meaning that a court order can be issued by “any court that is a court of competent jurisdiction” only if the government agency “offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.” When a state government agency is involved, a court order can’t be issued if the laws of the state prohibit it.

In many instances, customers might simply notice that their VMs aren’t functioning correctly or as expected. As with any incident response process, it’s assumed that customers have their own incident response teams to identify the problem, begin analyzing the extent of the problem, contain it, and begin remediation. Larger CSPs have their own incident response teams and work with the customer’s team to, for example,\n\nCSPs have their own incident response teams and work with the customer’s team to, for example, get access to affected VMs along with their backups and snapshots. A CSP incident response team should have its own forensics tools to use. What’s most important is that both parties should have procedures and resources in place to handle these events.\n\nThe NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group developed the following list of challenges in conducting cloud forensics.

                  "content": "Encryption in the Cloud\n\nMany CSPs and third parties offer encryption services for cloud users as a security measure, so you should expect to encounter encrypted files in cloud investigations. Knowing how encryption is used in cloud computing helps you plan your investigation and data acquisition. Capturing encrypted data in the cloud is handled the same way as acquiring any encrypted digital evidence, as discussed in Chapter 5. You need assistance from the data owner (the cloud user) or the CSP to decrypt data with the right encryption key. If the data owner is uncooperative, you might need to turn to the attorneys handling the case or the data owner’s management and have them direct the data owner to provide the information needed to access files.\n\nEncrypted data in the cloud is in two states: data at rest (data that has been written to disk) and data in motion (data being transmitted over a network). Some systems also have encryption for data in use (data that’s in RAM).\n\nNote\n\nSome public CSPs, such as Google Cloud Storage (https://cloud.google.com/storage/) and Microsoft OneDrive (https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/), provide encryption for data stored in the cloud and automatically decrypt it when data is accessed. Accessing data encrypted on these servers might require a live acquisition.\n\nMore CSPs and third-party vendors are offering cloud encryption tools for cloud customers. If you encounter encrypted data, you need to find out from the CSP what type of encryption was used and who knows how to recover this encrypted data. Some vendors that offer encryption services for cloud data are as follows:\n\nAtalla Cloud Encryption from Micro Focus (https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/software/data-security-encryption) provides trusted key management and data layer encryption that can encrypt virtual disks, databases, files, and more.\n\nTrend Micro SecureCloud (http://apac.trendmicro.com/apac/enterprise/cloud-solutions/secure-cloud/index.html) combines encryption with key management based on an organization’s security policies. SecureCloud can also wipe data after it’s deleted from cloud storage areas. Knowing about this feature is important when attempting to recover deleted data.\n\nSophos SafeGuard Encryption and Sophos Mobile Control (www.sophos.com/en-us/products/safeguard-encryption.aspx) provide automatic encryption and decryption for users’ uploads and downloads of data. Some public cloud services that can use these applications are Dropbox and OneDrive.\n\nCraig Gentry of IBM, a cryptography researcher, invented an encryption method called “fully homomorphic encryption.” Homomorphic encryption uses an “ideal lattice” mathematical formula to encrypt data. This formula uses abstract algebra’s ring theory to make encryption more difficult to break. For an explanation of ideal lattices and their use, see “On Ideal Lattices and Learning with Errors over Rings” (Vadim Lyubashevsky et al, https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13190-5_1, 2010). IBM acquired the patent on homomorphic encryption in 2013 (http://talkcloudcomputing.com/ibms-fully-homomorphic-encryption-technology-gets-patent/).\n\nBlock chain technology, used by companies such as Bitcoin, is a way to trace your information while keeping it secure. It’s defined as “an incorruptible ledger of economical transactions” (https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/). At the time of this writing, all banks in Dubai are required to use block chains by 2020 (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4064985-dubai-globalization-blockchain-technology-fintech), which will have a major impact on the way digital forensics procedures work.\n\nNote\n\nFor more information on homomorphic encryption, read about the work being done at Microsoft (www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/homomorphic-encryption/)."

              "content": "Acquisitions in the Cloud\n\nThe methods used to collect evidence in cloud investigations depend on the nature of the case. For example, an incident involving a network penetration through a CSP’s firewall requires collecting and examining firewall and server logs for attacker activities and ensuring that the company’s database hasn’t been accessed or corrupted. Investigating an unauthorized database access, on the other hand, means focusing on transaction logs, too.\n\nFor e-discovery and investigations that require collecting specific files and recovering deleted artifacts, the standard acquisition methods discussed in previous chapters must be used, whether they’re static or remote acquisitions. Recovering deleted data from cloud storage might be limited to the type of file system the CSP uses. For example, if a CSP uses a Microsoft NTFS RAID system, you can probably recover deleted data. This task might be more difficult if providers use Linux, UNIX, or another file system.\n\nAs you learned in Chapter 3, remote acquisitions are often more difficult because you’re usually dealing with large volumes of data and can be limited by the network speed. You might need to negotiate with attorneys and the CSP about limiting the collection to specific files to prevent scope creep. You can also set up another cloud system dedicated to the investigation, which should grant access only to authorized users, such as digital forensics examiners and first responders. If external network connections are needed, make sure they’re protected and monitored through a firewall to guard against unauthorized accesses.\n\nWith cloud systems running in a virtual environment, snapshots can give you valuable information before, during, and after an incident. Forensics examiners should re-create separate cloud servers from each snapshot, acquire an image of each server, and calculate an MD5 or SHA-1 hash for all files. They can then compare hash values, modified, MAC (modified, last accessed, and created) dates and times, and file access permission to see what changed between snapshots. With this information, they can determine what files were altered and a time range for when they were altered as well as what files need further inspection of their contents to see what was altered.\n\nNote\n\nTo learn more about this technique, see “Forensic Acquisition and Analysis of VMware Hard Disk” (Manish Hirwani, Yin Pan, Bill Stackpole, and Daryl Johnson, Rochester Institue of Technology, July 5, 2012, http://scholarworks.rit.edu/other/297/).\n\nOther factors add complexity to cloud investigations, such as physical servers in the cloud being able to host thousands of virtual networks with virtual switches that run through the same physical router. Unlike physical switches, the virtual switches can’t “see” each other. With this setup, VMs can have the same IP address and MAC address on each virtual network that could be owned or rented by different companies. There are also backups and snapshots for each VM as well as logs that show when a failover for a VM was used, when snapshots occurred, and so forth. Therefore, a CSP’s team must know how to isolate data that applies to the incident you’re investigating."

Is there a way to separate the data to prevent violating privacy rights or confidentiality agreements?\n\nIs the data of interest to the investigation local or remote? If it’s in a remote location, can the CSP provide a forensically sound connection to it?\n\nFor additional guidance on cloud investigations, see “NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges,” Draft NISTIR 8006 (https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/nistir/8006/draft/documents/draft_nistir_8006.pdf, 2014).

If a cloud customer doesn’t have the CSP’s application installed, you might find cloud-related evidence in a Web browser’s cache file. If the CSP’s application is installed, you can find evidence of file transfers in the application’s folder, usually under the user’s account folder, such as C:\\Users\\username.

They contain a log of prefetcher events along with the data and code accessed. The OS reads the associated prefetch file, which has a .pf extension, and loads its information into the computer’s memory to speed an application’s start time. This way, the OS can handle other tasks instead of waiting for an application to load the libraries it needs. Metadata in a prefetch file contains, for example, an application’s MAC times in UTC format and a counter of how many times the application has run since the prefetch file was created. If a prefetch file is deleted, Windows re-creates one that resets the MAC times and the counter.\n\nIn a prefetch file, the application’s create date and time are at offset 0x80, the modified date and time are at offset 0x88, the last access date and time are at offset 0x90, and the record date and time are at offset 0x98. The counter listing the number of times the application has run since creating the prefetch file is at offset 0xD4, as shown in Figure 13-1.

These services are free for storage up to 2 GB for Dropbox and up to 15 GB for Google Drive and OneDrive. Users can get more storage for a monthly subscription fee.\n\nWhen Dropbox or Google Drive is installed on a computer, File Explorer shows it as a separate folder, and data can be copied from and to it. OneDrive is already installed with Windows and is shown as a folder in File Explorer when a user activates his or her OneDrive account. If a user’s computer is offline, these services have storage on a user’s computer, and when Internet connectivity is restored, they update cloud-stored files based on the user’s stored files. If the user accesses the cloud service via the Web on the same computer or a different computer, updates to the original computer are made automatically when the Internet connection is reestablished.\n\nThe cloud services Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive have Registry entries, so even if a suspect uninstalls a cloud application, you can usually find information to show it was installed previously. The following sections describe what data to look for in Windows 8.1 and 10 systems that reveals an association with one of these cloud services. The locations of this data might vary in older Windows versions. For other OSs, such as Linux and macOS, you might need to do more research to test how cloud services interact with them. For example, Dropbox should be located in the ~/Dropbox folder in Linux.\n\nBecause security is such an important issue with cloud storage, users must maintain control over access to their cloud accounts. An unscrupulous person who cracks a user’s cloud password could upload illegal or compromising data to that user’s cloud via the Web. The next time the unsuspecting user connects to the cloud, this data is downloaded automatically to his or her computer’s synchronized folder. To determine whether this happened, you can review a CSP’s Web-connected login records and compare them with date and time values for the suspected files."

In the following activity, you use WinHex’s Data Interpreter to find an application’s MAC dates and times and the number of times Dropbox has run. You need WinHex, OSForensics, and the image file InCh05.img from Chapter 5. Follow these steps:\n\nNote\n\nBefore beginning this activity, create a Work\\Chap13\\Chapter folder (referred to as your “work folder” in the following steps).\n\n1.\n\nCopy InCh05.img from Chapter 5 to your work folder for this chapter. Start OSForensics with the Run as administrator option, and click Continue Using Trial Version. In the left pane, click Manage Case, if necessary. In the Manage Case pane on the right, click the New Case button. In the New Case dialog box, type InChap13 in the Case Name text box and your name in the Investigator text box. For the Acquisition Type setting, click the Investigate Disk(s) from Another Machine option button, and click Custom Location for the Case Folder setting. Click the Browse button, navigate to and click your work folder, and then click OK twice.\n\n2.\n\nTo mount the disk image, scroll down the navigation pane on the left and click Mount Drive Image.\n\n3.\n\nIn the “Mounted virtual disks” window, click the Mount new button. In the OSFMount - Mount drive dialog box that opens, click the … button next to the Image file text box, navigate to your work folder, click InCh05.img , click Open, and then click OK.\n\n4.\n\nClick File Name Search in the left pane, click the … button next to the Config button, navigate to and click the drive letter where you mounted InCh05.img, and then click OK. In the Search String text box, type DROPBOX, and then click Search.\n\n5.\n\nWhen the search is finished, scroll through the list of results and find the DROPBOX.EXE-AA3E8112.pf file in the path C:\\Windows\\Prefetch (although your drive letter might differ). Right-click this file and click Open With.\n\n6.\n\nIn the How do you want to open this file? dialog box, click Look for another app on this PC. In the “Open with” window, navigate to C:\\Program Files \\WinHex(or the location where you installed WinHex), and click WinHex.exe .\n\n7.\n\nIn WinHex, click View from the menu, point to Show, and click Data Interpreter. Click Options, Data Interpreter from the menu to open the Data Interpreter Options dialog box. Click the Win32 FILETIME (64 bit) check box, if necessary, and then click OK.\n\n8.\n\nClick offset 0x80, and notice the date and time displayed in the Data Interpreter window. Repeat by clicking at offsets 0x88, 0x90, and 0x98 to view the other dates and times.\n\n9.\n\nClick Options, Data Interpreter from the menu again, click to clear the Win32 FILETIME (64 bit) check box, click the 8 bit, unsigned check box, and then click OK.\n\n10.\n\nMove the cursor and click at offset 0xD4 to see how many times this application has been run.

For example, if a CSP is a victim of a cyberattack, the investigation should follow network forensics techniques (covered in Chapters 9 and 10). If the investigation involves searching for and recovering data from cloud storage or cloud customers, review the tools described in Chapters 5 and 6."
