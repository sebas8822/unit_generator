The "Content Object" Structure
Each slide's body content is defined by a list of one or two "Content Objects". Each object in the objects list is a dictionary with three key fields: content_type, content_purpose, and data.
1. content_type: What is the fundamental format of the data?
Standard Content Types
"bullet_points": A list of text items, which can be simple strings or nested objects to create multi-level lists. This is the most common and versatile content type.
"table": Structured tabular data, containing headers and rows. Ideal for presenting data sets, feature comparisons, or any information best organized in a grid.
"image": A placeholder for an image. The data would contain the path or URL to an image file. This allows for visual content like diagrams, photos, or pre-rendered SmartArt graphics.
Interactive Content Types
"multiple_choice_question": A self-contained quiz item, including a question, a set of answer options, and the correct answer. Designed for knowledge checks.
"matching_activity": An activity where users must match items from one list (e.g., terms) to corresponding items in a second list (e.g., definitions). The system will shuffle one of the lists for presentation.
2. content_purpose: What is the semantic goal of this content?
Descriptive Purposes
"description": Used for providing concise, factual information. Standard bullet points, lists of features, or simple statements.
"explanation": Used for breaking down a concept in more detail. Explains the 'how' or 'why' behind a topic, often with more elaborated points than a simple description.
"timeline": Represents a sequence of events ordered chronologically. Ideal for historical overviews or project milestones.
"process": Describes a series of steps or stages in a sequential order to achieve a specific outcome. Example: The steps of a digital forensics investigation.
"cycle": A process where the steps loop back to the beginning, illustrating a continuous or repeating sequence. Example: The Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle.
"comparison" / "contrast": Used to highlight the similarities (comparison) and differences (contrast) between two or more items. Best used in a two-column layout.
"hierarchy": Shows the relationship between items at different levels of organization. Perfect for organizational charts, topic breakdowns, or nested structures.
"case_study" / "example": Illustrates a concept, principle, or theory with a specific, real-world instance or story. Grounds abstract ideas in tangible reality.
Interactive Purposes
"knowledge_check": The purpose is to test the audience's understanding or recall of information presented. Directly associated with the multiple_choice_question type.
"terminology_review": The purpose is to test the audience's familiarity with key terms and their definitions. Directly associated with the matching_activity type.
"case_analysis": The purpose is to ask the audience to apply their knowledge to interpret or make a judgment about a given scenario or case study. Often paired with a case_study in a two-column layout.
3. data: The actual content, formatted according to its content_type.
This section contains the specific, structured data that the PresentationAgent will render onto the slide based on the rules defined by the content_type and content_purpose.

      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "description",
      "data": [
        "The application of computer science and investigative procedures for a legal purpose.",

        "Applies to civil, criminal, and administrative cases."
      ]
    }
  ]
}

How This Structure Works:
Simplicity and Clarity: The content_purpose: "description" signals that this is a simple, informative slide. There are no complex relationships between the points—they are a collection of key facts.
Standard Layout: The PresentationAgent would see one object in the objects list and select a standard single-column layout (like layout_index: 1 or 3).
Direct Rendering: The data is a simple list of strings, which the add_formatted_text function in your current script can handle perfectly, rendering each string as a top-level bullet point on the slide.


"timeline": A sequence of events, usually with dates.

"llm_generated_content": {
  "title": "A Brief History of Digital Forensics",
  "subtitle": "Key Milestones and Developments",
  "objects": [
    {
      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "timeline",
      "data": [
        "1970s: Electronic crimes, particularly white-collar fraud, increase with the use of mainframe computers in the financial sector.",
        "1980s: PCs gain popularity, leading to the first forensics tools being developed by government agencies like the IRS and RCMP.",
        "Mid-1980s: The first commercial tools for file recovery, like Xtree Gold and Norton DiskEdit, become available.",
        "1987: Apple's Mac SE introduces a 60 MB hard disk, representing a major advance in data storage for personal computers.",
        "Early 1990s: Specialized commercial forensics software like Expert Witness and EnCase emerges, marking the start of the modern digital forensics industry."
      ]
    }
  ]
}

How This Structure Works:
Chronological Flow: The content_purpose: "timeline" signals that the order of the bullet points is critical and represents a sequence of events. Each point logically follows the one before it in time.
Visual Hint for SmartArt: While the script will currently render this as a standard bulleted list, the timeline purpose is a powerful hint. An enhanced version of the PresentationAgent could use this cue to automatically select a "Basic Timeline" SmartArt graphic, feeding each bullet point into a corresponding stage of the visual timeline.
Standard Rendering: The PresentationAgent will see a single object and use a standard single-column layout. The add_formatted_text function will render the list as-is, creating a clear and easy-to-read historical overview.



"process": A series of sequential steps towards a final outcome.


"llm_generated_content": {
  "title": "The Digital Forensics Process",
  "subtitle": "Key Stages of an Investigation",
  "objects": [
    {
      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "process",
      "data": [
        "1. Identification: Recognizing and determining the potential sources of digital evidence relevant to the case.",
        "2. Preservation & Collection: Securing and isolating digital devices to prevent alteration. This includes creating forensically sound copies (images) and maintaining a strict chain of custody.",
        "3. Examination: Using forensic tools and techniques to uncover relevant data from the preserved copies. This includes searching for visible, deleted, and hidden files.",
        "4. Analysis: Interpreting the results of the examination to draw conclusions, reconstruct events, and piece together evidence.",
        "5. Reporting & Presentation: Documenting all findings in a comprehensive report and presenting the evidence in a legally admissible manner, often as an expert witness in court."
      ]
    }
  ]
}

How This Structure Works:
Sequential Order: The content_purpose: "process" clearly communicates that this is a sequence of actions. The numbered bullets visually reinforce this step-by-step flow.
Visual Hint for SmartArt: This is a perfect candidate for a visual process diagram. An advanced PresentationAgent could use the "process" purpose as a cue to select a "Continuous Block Process" or a similar sequential SmartArt graphic, turning the text into a more engaging visual.
Standard Rendering: For the current script, the implementation is straightforward. It will detect a single object, choose a single-column layout, and use add_formatted_text to render the numbered list of steps onto the slide.

"llm_generated_content": {
  "title": "The Incident Response Lifecycle",
  "subtitle": "A Continuous Cycle of Improvement",
  "objects": [
    {
      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "cycle",
      "data": [
        "1. Preparation: Establishing the tools, policies, and procedures needed to respond to an incident before one occurs.",
        "2. Identification: Detecting and verifying that a security incident has happened and determining its scope.",
        "3. Containment: Limiting the damage from the incident and preventing it from spreading to other systems.",
        "4. Eradication: Finding and eliminating the root cause of the incident (e.g., removing malware).",
        "5. Recovery: Restoring the affected systems and data to normal operation.",
        "6. Lessons Learned: Analyzing the incident to improve security controls and the response process itself, which directly informs the Preparation phase for the future."
      ]
    }
  ]
}

How This Structure Works:
Looping Logic: The content_purpose: "cycle" explicitly tells the system that these steps are not a one-time sequence but a continuous loop. The final point in the data makes this clear by stating that "Lessons Learned" feeds back into "Preparation."
Strong Visual Cue for SmartArt: This is one of the strongest hints for using a specific visual aid. The "cycle" purpose is a clear instruction to an advanced PresentationAgent to use a "Basic Cycle" or "Block Cycle" SmartArt graphic to visually represent the looping nature of the process.
Standard Rendering: The current script will handle this by creating a single-column slide with a numbered list. While this doesn't visually show the cycle, the content remains clear and logically structured, ensuring the core information is conveyed effectively.



contrans / comparison 

"llm_generated_content": {
  "title": "Comparison: Key Disciplines",
  "subtitle": "Digital Forensics vs. Data Recovery",
  "objects": [
    {
      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "comparison",
      "data": [
        {
          "text": "Digital Forensics",
          "children": [
            "Goal: To analyze data for use as legally admissible evidence.",
            "Methodology: Follows a strict scientific process, including a chain of custody.",
            "Target Data: Often involves recovering hidden, deleted, or unknown information."
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "contrast",
      "data": [
        {
          "text": "Data Recovery",
          "children": [
            "Goal: To retrieve information lost accidentally or due to system failure.",
            "Methodology: Focuses on successful retrieval, not legal admissibility.",
            "Target Data: Typically involves recovering known files that are simply missing."
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


How This Structure Works:
Clear Purpose: The title and subtitle immediately establish the slide's intent. The content_purpose fields ("comparison" and "contrast") provide machine-readable context for the script.
Parallel Structure: The data in both objects is structured identically. Each has a main heading ("Digital Forensics" and "Data Recovery") and a set of child bullet points that directly correspond to each other (Goal vs. Goal, Methodology vs. Methodology, etc.). This is a best practice for creating effective comparison visuals.
Simple Execution for the Agent:
The PresentationAgent will detect two objects in the objects list.
It will select a two-column layout from the layout_mapping.json.
It will render the first object's data into the left placeholder. The nested structure will correctly create a main bullet point with indented sub-points.
It will then render the second object's data into the right placeholder in the same manner.


Case study  with explanation type 2 - "case_study" / "example"
"llm_generated_content": {
  "title": "Developing Digital Forensics Resources",
  "subtitle": "The Value of Community and Outside Expertise",
  "objects": [
    {
      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "explanation",
      "data": [
        "No investigator can be an expert in every technology.",
        "It is crucial to develop and maintain contacts with other professionals.",
        "Computer user groups are an invaluable resource, especially for obscure or older systems.",
        "Cultivating a network of experts in different fields (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) is essential for success."
      ]
    },
    {
      "content_type": "bullet_points",
      "content_purpose": "example",
      "data": [
        {
          "text": "Case: Pierce County, 1996",
          "children": [
            "Police seized a suspect's computer that used 'CoCo DOS', an obsolete operating system."
          ]
        },
        {
          "text": "Action: The investigator contacted a local user group.",
          "children": [
            "The group supplied the necessary commands and information to access the system."
          ]
        },
        {
          "text": "Outcome:",
          "children": [
            "A diary was found detailing crimes against hundreds of victims, resulting in a much longer sentence for the suspect."
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

How This System Works:
Flexibility: This structure is incredibly flexible. The left object is the case study. The right object is the question. You could easily swap the right object for a different content_type, like a "matching_activity" or even just a descriptive bullet_points object, without having to change the case study on the left.
Modularity: Each object is self-contained. The PresentationAgent's logic is simple:
It sees there are two objects in the objects list.
It grabs a two-column slide layout.
For the first placeholder: It sees content_type: "bullet_points" and calls the standard function to render a list of text.
For the second placeholder: It sees content_type: "multiple_choice_question" and calls the specialized function to render the question, options, and answer.

      "content_purpose": "knowledge_check",
      "data": {
        "question_text": "Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of digital forensics as defined by NIST?",
        "options": [
          { "label": "A", "text": "To recover deleted files for data recovery purposes" },
          { "label": "B", "text": "To examine and analyze data from computer storage media for use as evidence in court" },

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

How the PresentationAgent Would Use This:
With this new structure, the Python script's job becomes much clearer and more reliable:
Dispatcher Logic: Inside _add_slide_for_item, the script would see content_type: "multiple_choice_question" and call a new, dedicated function like create_question_slide(slide, data).
Populating the Slide: This new function would:
Place the data['question_text'] into the main body placeholder.
Iterate through the data['options'] list and create a formatted string (e.g., "A) To recover...") for each one, adding them as distinct paragraphs.
Place the data['correct_answer']['label'] into a specific, smaller placeholder intended for the answer (like Text Placeholder 5 in your interactive layouts).
The explanation could be hidden by default and shown on a subsequent slide or an animation click, providing a path for future enhancements.


Maching Activity

      "data": {
        "instruction_text": "Match the term in Column A with its correct definition in Column B.",
        "pairs": [
          {
            "term": "Digital Forensics",
            "definition": "The application of science to identify, collect, and analyze data while preserving integrity and a strict chain of custody."
          },
          {
            "term": "Data Recovery",
            "definition": "The process of retrieving information that was deleted by mistake or lost during a power surge or server crash."
          },
          {
            "term": "Case Law",
            "definition": "Used when statutes or regulations don’t exist, allowing legal counsel to apply previous similar cases to current ones."
          },
          {
            "term": "Investigations Triad",
            "definition": "A model combining vulnerability assessment, network intrusion detection, and digital investigations."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}


How the PresentationAgent Would Use This:
This is where the intelligence in the script comes into play. Upon seeing content_type: "matching_activity", a new function create_matching_slide(slide, data) would execute the following logic:
It would require a slide layout with two main body placeholders (e.g., your layout_index: 2 or 4).
It would extract the list of terms from the data.pairs array.
It would extract the list of definitions from the data.pairs array.
Crucially, it would shuffle the definitions list to ensure the items are not in the correct order on the slide.
It would populate the left placeholder with a numbered list of the terms.
It would populate the right placeholder with a lettered list of the shuffled definitions.
The solution (the original pairings) is known from the JSON and can be revealed on a subsequent animation or slide.
This approach cleanly separates the data's logical structure (the correct pairs) from its visual presentation (two shuffled lists), making the system both powerful and easy to manage.
