      "Understanding Case Law\n",
      "Existing laws and statutes simply can’t keep up with the rate of technological change. Therefore, when statutes or regulations don’t exist, case law is used. In common law nations, such as the United States, case law allows legal counsel to apply previous similar cases to current ones in an effort to address ambiguity in laws. Examiners must be familiar with recent court rulings on search and seizure in the electronic environment to avoid mistakes such as exceeding a search warrant’s authority. Recent events involving privacy incursions by government agencies have resulted in new laws and policies. Developments in technology have changed how everyday events are viewed. For example, what should be considered private conversations? Which devices are actually protected?\n",
      "Although law enforcement can certainly confiscate anything an arrested person is carrying and log that a device, such as a smartphone, was on the person, they don’t necessarily have the right or authority to search the device. These actions are being challenged in courts constantly. Remaining vigilant in keeping up with changing case law is critical to being an effective digital forensics investigator.\n",
