      "Collecting Evidence in Private-Sector Incident Scenes\n",
      "Private-sector organizations include small to medium businesses, large corporations, and non-government organizations (NGOs), which might get funding from the government or other agencies. In the United States, NGOs and similar agencies must comply with state public disclosure and federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) laws and make certain documents available as public records. State public disclosure laws define state public records as open and available for inspection. For example, divorces recorded in a public office, such as a courthouse, become matters of public record unless a judge orders the documents sealed. Anyone can request a copy of a public divorce decree. Figure 4-3 shows an excerpt of a public disclosure law for the state of Idaho.\n",
      "State public disclosure laws apply to state records, but the FOIA allows citizens to request copies of public documents created by federal agencies. The FOIA was originally enacted in the 1960s, and several subsequent amendments have broadened its laws. Some Web sites now provide copies of publicly accessible records for a fee.\n",
      "ISPs and other communication companies make up a special category of private-sector businesses. ISPs can investigate computer abuse committed by their employees but not by customers. They must preserve customer privacy, especially when dealing with e-mail. However, federal regulations related to the Homeland Security Act and the PATRIOT Act of 2001 have redefined how ISPs and large organizations operate and maintain their records. ISPs and other communication companies can be called on to investigate customers’ activities that are deemed to create an emergency situation. An emergency situation under the PATRIOT Act is defined as the immediate risk of death or personal injury, such as finding a bomb threat in an e-mail.\n",
      "As recent events have shown, the government monitors e-mails for the occurrence of keywords. Incidents such as the Edward Snowden case have made public the amount of electronic surveillance done by the U.S. government and the governments of other countries. Some provisions of these federal regulations have been revised over the past few years, so you should stay abreast of their implications. For example, in March 2017, the U.S. Congress voted to allow ISPs to sell customers’ browsing histories without their explicit permission. (See www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/34 for more details.)\n",
      "Investigating and controlling computer incident scenes in private-sector environments is much easier than in crime scenes. In the private sector, the incident scene is often a workplace, such as a contained office or manufacturing area, where a policy violation is being investigated. Everything from the computers used to violate a company policy to the surrounding facility is under a controlled authority—that is, company management. Typically, businesses have inventory databases of computer hardware and software. Having access to these databases and knowing what applications are on suspected computers help identify the forensics tools needed to analyze a policy violation and the best way to conduct the analysis. For example, companies might have a preferred Web browser, such as Microsoft\n",
      "conduct the analysis. For example, companies might have a preferred Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Google Chrome. Knowing which browser a suspect used helps you develop standard examination procedures to identify data downloaded to the suspect’s workstation.\n",
      "To investigate employees suspected of improper use of company digital assets, a company policy statement about misuse of digital assets allows private-sector investigators to conduct covert surveillance with little or no cause and access company computer systems and digital devices without a warrant, which is an advantage. Law enforcement investigators can’t do the same, however, without sufficient reason for a warrant.\n",
      "However, if a company doesn’t display a warning banner or publish a policy stating that it reserves the right to inspect digital assets at will, employees have an expectation of privacy (as explained in Chapter 1). When an employee is being investigated, this expected privacy prevents the employer from legally conducting an intrusive investigation. A well-defined company policy, therefore, should state that an employer has the right to examine, inspect, or access any company-owned digital assets. If a company issues a policy statement to all employees, the employer can investigate digital assets at will without any privacy right restrictions; this practice might violate the privacy laws of countries in the EU, for example. As a standard practice, companies should use both warning banners\n",
      "countries in the EU, for example. As a standard practice, companies should use both warning banners and policy statements. For example, if an incident is escalated to a criminal complaint, prosecutors prefer showing juries warning banners instead of policy manuals. A warning banner leaves a much stronger impression on a jury.\n",
      "In addition to making sure a company has a policy statement or a warning banner, private-sector investigators should know under what circumstances they can examine an employee’s computer. With a policy statement, an employer can freely initiate any inquiry necessary to protect the company or organization. However, organizations must also have a well-defined process describing when an investigation can be initiated. At a minimum, most company policies require that employers have a “reasonable suspicion” that a law or policy is being violated. For example, if a policy states that employees can’t use company computers for outside business and a supervisor notices a change in work behavior that could indicate an employee is violating this rule, generally it’s enough to warrant an\n",
      "that could indicate an employee is violating this rule, generally it’s enough to warrant an investigation. However, some countries require notifying employees that they’re being investigated if they’re suspected of criminal behavior at work.\n",
      "If a private-sector investigator finds that an employee is committing or has committed a crime, the employer can file a criminal complaint with the police. Some businesses, such as banks, have a regulatory requirement to report crimes. In the United States, the employer must turn over all evidence to the police for prosecution. If this evidence had been collected by a law enforcement officer, it would require a warrant, which would be difficult to get without sufficient probable cause. In “Processing Law Enforcement Crime Scenes” later in this chapter, you learn more about probable cause and how it applies to a criminal investigation.\n",
      "Employers are usually interested in enforcing company policy, not seeking out and prosecuting employees, so typically they approve digital investigations only to identify employees who are misusing company assets. Private-sector investigators are, therefore, concerned mainly with protecting company assets, such as intellectual property. Finding evidence of a criminal act during an investigation escalates the investigation from an internal civil matter to an external criminal complaint. In some situations, such as the discovery of child pornography, the company or its agents must notify law enforcement immediately.\n",
      "If you discover evidence of a crime during a company policy investigation, first determine whether the incident meets the elements of criminal law. You might have to consult with your organization’s attorney to determine whether the situation is a potential crime. Next, inform management of the incident; they might have other concerns, such as protecting confidential business data that could be included with the criminal evidence (called “commingled data”). In this case, coordinate with management and the organization’s attorney to determine the best way to protect commingled data. After you submit evidence containing sensitive information to the police, it becomes public record. Public record laws do include exceptions for protecting sensitive company information; ultimately, however, a\n",
      "laws do include exceptions for protecting sensitive company information; ultimately, however, a judge decides what to protect.\n",
      "After you discover illegal activity and document and report the crime, stop your investigation to make sure you don’t violate Fourth Amendment restrictions on obtaining evidence. If the information you supply is specific enough to meet the criteria for a search warrant, the police are responsible for obtaining a warrant that requests any new evidence. If you follow police instructions to gather additional evidence without a search warrant after you have reported the crime, you run the risk of becoming an agent of law enforcement. Instead, consult with your organization’s attorney on how to respond to a police request for information. The police and prosecutor should issue a subpoena for any additional new evidence, which minimizes your exposure to potential civil liability. In addition,\n",
      "additional new evidence, which minimizes your exposure to potential civil liability. In addition, you should keep all documentation of evidence collected to investigate an internal company policy violation. Later in this section, you learn more about using affidavits in an internal investigation.\n",
      "One example of a company policy violation involves employees observing another employee accessing pornographic Web sites. If your organization’s policy requires you to determine whether any evidence supports this accusation, you could start by extracting log file data from the proxy server (used to connect a company LAN to the Internet) and conducting a forensic examination of the subject’s computer. Suppose that during your examination, you find adult and child pornography. Further examination of the subject’s hard disk reveals that the employee has been collecting child pornography in separate folders on his workstation’s hard drive. In the United States, possessing child pornography is a crime under federal and state criminal statutes. These situations aren’t uncommon and make life\n",
      "a crime under federal and state criminal statutes. These situations aren’t uncommon and make life difficult for investigators who don’t want to be guilty of possession of this contraband on their forensic workstations.\n",
      "You survey the remaining content of the subject’s drive and find that he’s a lead engineer for the team developing your company’s latest high-tech bicycle. He placed the child pornography images in a subfolder where the bicycle plans are stored. By doing so, he has commingled contraband with the company’s confidential design plans for the bicycle. Your discovery poses two problems in dealing with this contraband evidence. First, you must report the crime to the police; all U.S. states and most countries have legal and moral codes when evidence of sexual exploitation of children is found. Second, you must also protect sensitive company information. Letting the high-tech bicycle plans become part of the criminal evidence might make it public record, and the design work will then be available\n",
      "of the criminal evidence might make it public record, and the design work will then be available to competitors. Your first step is to ask your organization’s attorney how to deal with the commingled contraband data and sensitive design plans.\n",
      "Your next step is to work with the attorney to write an affidavit confirming your findings. The attorney should indicate in the affidavit that the evidence is commingled with company secrets, and releasing the information will be detrimental to the company’s financial health. When the affidavit is completed, you sign it before a notary, and then deliver the affidavit and the recovered evidence with log files to the police, where you make a criminal complaint. At the same time, the attorney goes to court and requests that all evidence recovered from the hard disk that’s not related to the complaint and is a company trade secret be protected from public viewing. You and the attorney have reported the crime and taken steps to protect the sensitive data.\n",
      "Now suppose the detective assigned to the case calls you. In the evidence you’ve turned over to the police, the detective notices that the suspect is collecting most of his contraband from e-mail attachments. The prosecutor needs you to collect more evidence to determine whether the suspect is transmitting contraband pictures to other potential suspects. The detective realizes that collecting more evidence might make you an agent of law enforcement and violate the employee’s Fourth Amendment rights, so she writes an affidavit for a search warrant, ensuring that any subsequent instructions to you are legal. Before collecting any additional information, you wait until you or your organization’s attorney gets a subpoena, search warrant, or other court order.\n",
