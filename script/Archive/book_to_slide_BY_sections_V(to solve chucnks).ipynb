      "Chapter 15. Expert Testimony in Digital Investigations\n",
      "After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able to:\n",
      "Explain guidelines for giving testimony as a fact witness or an expert witness\n",
      "Describe guidelines for testifying in court\n",
      "Explain guidelines for testifying in depositions and hearings\n",
      "Describe procedures for preparing forensics evidence for testimony\n",
      "This chapter explains the rules of evidence and procedure as they apply to testimony. You learn about the types of testimony—for trials, depositions, and hearings—and the difference between a fact witness and an expert witness. In addition, you learn how to avoid some common problems of testimony and learn some techniques you can use to increase the value of your testimony. This chapter also offers an example of how to prepare forensics evidence for testimony.\n",
      "Preparing for Testimony\n",
      "When cases go to trial or a hearing involving testimony, you as a forensics examiner can play one of two roles: a fact witness This type of testimony reports only the facts (findings of an investigation); no opinion is given in court. providing technical or scientific evidence or an expert witness This type of testimony reports opinions based on experience and facts gathered during an investigation. . As a fact witness, you provide only the facts you have found in your investigation—any evidence that meets the relevance standard and is more probative than prejudicial. When you give technical or scientific testimony, you present this evidence and explain what it is and how it was obtained. You don’t offer conclusions, only the facts and ordinary inferences based on that evidence. However,\n",
      "don’t offer conclusions, only the facts and ordinary inferences based on that evidence. However, as an expert witness, you have opinions about what you have found or observed. You form these opinions from experience and deductive reasoning based on facts found during an investigation. In fact, it’s your opinion that makes you an expert witness.\n",
      "For either type of testimony, you need to prepare thoroughly. Establish communication early with your attorney. Before you start processing evidence, learn about the victim, the complainant, opposing experts or fact witnesses, and the opposing attorney as soon as possible. Learn the basic points of the dispute. As you learn about the case, take notes, but keep them in rough draft form and record only the facts, keeping your opinions to a minimum. (As explained in Chapter 14, any written material is subject to discovery, so use caution in what you put in written form.)\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Your attorney can give you specific guidelines in preparing for the case. Remember that as an expert witness, you work for the attorney, not the client (plaintiff or defendant), so if you discover negative findings, communicate them as soon as possible to your attorney.\n",
      "As part of your preparation, you might want to review your own documentation and confirm your findings by corroborating them with other digital forensics professionals. Return to the notes you took during your investigation. If you’re working with electronic notes, use care in storing them. In your analysis and reporting, develop and maintain a standard method of processing to minimize confusion and help you prepare for testimony later. Digital forensics is only now developing a peer review process. To get a peer review, often you have to search outside your region. Learn to take advantage of your professional network and request peer reviews to help support your findings.\n",
      "You might also want to use the Internet to research opposing experts and try to find their strengths and weaknesses in previous testimony. Review their curriculum vitae, if possible, and see how they present themselves. To do otherwise is to go into battle without trying to know your opponent. Your attorney might be able to get copies of depositions they have given in other cases, usually from the deposition banks mentioned in Chapter 14, but also from lectures, classes, and presentations that have been summarized or recorded and posted online. Some organizations of forensics investigators also maintain e-mail lists that you can use to query members about other expert witnesses.\n",
      "Review the following questions when preparing your testimony:\n",
      "What’s the client’s overall theory of the case?\n",
      "What’s my story of the case (the central facts relevant to my testimony)?\n",
      "What can I say with confidence?\n",
      "How does my opinion fit into the theory of the case?\n",
      "What’s the scope of the case? Have I gone too far?\n",
      "Have I identified the client’s needs for how my testimony fits into the overall theory of the case?\n",
      "Documenting and Preparing Evidence\n",
      "As emphasized in previous chapters, document your steps in gathering and preserving evidence to make sure they’re repeatable, in case you’re challenged. If your findings can’t be repeated, they lose credibility as evidence. In addition, validate your tools and verify your evidence with hash algorithms to ensure its integrity. (Refer to Chapter 9 for guidelines on using hash algorithms.) The following guidelines are also useful in ensuring the integrity of your evidence:\n",
      "If you need a checklist to analyze evidence, create it only for a specific case. Don’t create a formal checklist of your procedures that’s applied to all your cases or include such a checklist in your report. If opposing counsel gets this checklist through discovery, you might be challenged during cross-examination about inconsistencies in your performance if you deviated from the checklist.\n",
      "As a standard practice, collect evidence and record the tools you used in designated file folders or evidence containers. This method helps organize your evidence and tools. Follow a system to record where items are kept for each case and how documentation is stored.\n",
      "Remember that the chain of custody of evidence supports the integrity of your evidence; do whatever you can to prevent contamination of the evidence. You should also document any lapse or gap in evidence preservation or custody. Lapses and gaps don’t necessarily result in evidence being inadmissible, but they might affect the weight given to the evidence.\n",
      "When collecting evidence, be careful not to get too little or too much information. For litigation, you’re responsible for collecting only what’s asked for, no more. In some circumstances, collecting and identifying evidence on facts unrelated to the case could cause problems for your attorney.\n",
      "Make sure you note the date and time of your forensic workstation when starting your analysis. If precise time is an issue, consider using an Internet clock, such as the one at www.time.gov or www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/its.cfm (downloading nistime-32bit.exe), or an atomic clock to verify the accuracy of your workstation’s clock. Many retailers, such as Walmart and Radio Shack, now sell atomic clocks.\n",
      "Keep only successful output when running analysis tools; don’t keep previous runs, such as those missing necessary switch or output settings. Note that you used the tool, but it didn’t generate results because of these missing settings.\n",
      "When searching for keyword results, rerun searches with well-defined keywords and search parameters. You might even want to state how they relate to the case, such as being business or personal names. Narrow the search to reduce false hits, and eliminate search results containing false-positive hits.\n",
      "When taking notes of your findings, keep them simple and specific to the investigation. You should avoid any personal comments so that you don’t have to explain them to opposing counsel.\n",
      "When writing your report, list only the evidence that’s relevant to the case; do not include unrelated findings.\n",
      "Define any procedures you use to conduct your analysis as scientific and conforming to your profession’s standards. Listing textbooks, technical books, articles by recognized experts, and procedures from highly respected professional organizations that you relied on or referenced during your examination is a common way to prove your conformity with scientific and professional standards.\n",
      "Reviewing Your Role as a Consulting Expert or an Expert Witness\n",
      "Depending on your attorney’s needs, you might give him or her just your opinion and technical expertise instead of testifying in court; this role is called a “consulting expert.” If your role changes from consulting expert to expert witness later, however, your previous work as a consulting expert is subject to discovery by opposing counsel. For this reason, don’t record conversations or phone calls.\n",
      "When you appear in a federal court as an expert witness, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 26 (2) (B) requires that you provide the following information:\n",
      "Other cases in which you have testified as an expert at a trial or in a deposition in the preceding four years\n",
      "Ten years of any published writings\n",
      "Previous compensation you received when giving testimony\n",
      "In addition, the court can appoint its own expert witnesses. Court-appointed expert witnesses must be neutral in their opinions, and they must be knowledgeable in their field. As an expert hired by the defense or plaintiff, you need to evaluate the court’s expert. Make sure you brief your attorney on your findings and opinion of the court’s expert to help your attorney deal with any testimony the court-appointed expert provides.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "When approached to give expert testimony, find out whether you’re the first one asked. If you aren’t, find out why other experts might have been contacted but not retained.\n",
      "Creating and Maintaining Your CV\n",
      "Your curriculum vitae (CV) An extensive outline of your professional history that includes education, training, work, and what cases you have worked on as well as training you have conducted, publications you have contributed to, and professional associations and awards. lists your education, training, and professional experience and is used to qualify your testimony. For forensics examiners, keeping this document updated and complete is crucial to supporting your role as an expert and showing that you’re constantly enhancing your skills through training, teaching, and experience.\n",
      "Your CV should describe tasks you’ve performed that define specific accomplishments and your basic and advanced skills. You should also list your general and professional education and professional training. If the list of training is extremely lengthy, use a heading such as “Selected Training Attended.” Be sure to include coursework sponsored by government agencies or organizations that train government agency personnel and courses sponsored or approved by professional associations, such as bar associations. Also, note any professional training you provided or contributed to. You must also include a testimony log that reflects every testimony you have given as an expert.\n",
      "Make sure your CV reflects your professional background. Unlike a job resume, it should not be geared toward a specific trial. Most important, keep your CV current and date it for version control. If your CV is more than three months old, you probably need to update it to reflect new cases and additional training.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Keep a separate list of books on your area of expertise that you’ve read, but don’t include this list in your CV because it might suggest that you approve of everything written in these books.\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "For more information on how to write a CV, see www.testifyingtraining.com/write-curriculum-vitae-cv-expert-witness-work/ and www.academyofexperts.org/guidance/expert-witnesses/expert-witness-cv-template.\n",
      "Preparing Technical Definitions\n",
      "Before you testify in court, prepare definitions of technical concepts you can use when questioned by your attorney and the opposing attorney. Make sure you use your own words, and remember that you’re explaining these concepts for a nontechnical audience. You might want to practice explaining your definitions and concepts with a person who has limited technical skills to confirm that your statements are understandable. You don’t need to make the jury subject matter experts; you’re simply explaining the general meaning of these terms. The following are examples of definitions to prepare ahead of time for your testimony:\n",
      "Digital forensics or computer forensics\n",
      "CRC-32, MD5, and SHA-1 hashing algorithms\n",
      "Image files and bit-stream copies\n",
      "File slack and unallocated (free) space\n",
      "File timestamps\n",
      "Computer log files\n",
      "Folder or directory\n",
      "Hardware\n",
      "Software\n",
      "Operating system\n",
      "Preparing to Deal with the News Media\n",
      "Some legal actions generate interest from the news media, but you should avoid contact with news media, especially during a case, for the following reasons:\n",
      "Your comments could harm the case and create a record that can be used against you.\n",
      "You have no control over the context of the information a journalist publishes.\n",
      "You can’t rely on a journalist’s promises of confidentiality. Journalists have been known to be aggressive in getting information, and their interests do not coincide with yours or your client’s. Be on guard at all times because your comments could be interpreted in a manner that taints your impartiality in this case and future cases. Even after the case is resolved, avoid discussing details with the press.\n",
      "If you’re solicited for information or opinions by journalists (or anyone else), refrain from saying anything, and refer them to your client (the attorney who retained you). If you can’t avoid a journalist, consult with your attorney and determine how to handle the situation. Plan to record any attempted interviews so that you have your own record of what occurred. (Note, however, that state laws on consent for recording vary.) This recording can be important if you’re misquoted or quoted out of context. Reporters often look for a sensational sound bite or controversial quote.\n",
      "Testifying in Court\n",
      "Before you’re called to testify in court, you should become familiar with the usual procedures followed during a trial. First, your attorney examines you about your qualifications to demonstrate to the court that you’re competent as an expert witness or a fact witness. The opposing counsel might then cross-examine you on your qualifications (perhaps in an attempt to discredit you). Next, your attorney guides you through your testimony, and then opposing counsel can cross-examine you on your testimony. Your attorney might then have an opportunity for redirect examination of material addressed in cross-examination. After your testimony, you might be called back to update your testimony, or you might be called as a rebuttal witness.\n",
      "Understanding the Trial Process\n",
      "The typical order of trial proceedings, whether civil or criminal, is as follows:\n",
      "Motion in limine—A pretrial motion to exclude or limit the use of certain evidence because its potential to prejudice the jury would exceed its probative value. Effectively, this motion is a written list of objections to certain testimony or exhibits. It allows the judge to decide whether certain evidence should be admitted when the jury isn’t present. Some evidence is so prejudicial that just the jury knowing it exists is enough to damage the case. In this situation, getting a ruling on the evidence before trial is crucial.\n",
      "Impaneling the jury—This process includes voir dire of venireman (questioning potential jurors to see whether they’re qualified), strikes (rejecting potential jurors), and seating of jurors.\n",
      "Opening statements—Both attorneys provide an overview of the case, with the plaintiff’s attorney going first.\n",
      "Plaintiff—The plaintiff’s attorney presents the case.\n",
      "Defense—The defense’s attorney presents the case.\n",
      "Rebuttal—Rebuttal from both the plaintiff’s and defense’s attorneys is an optional phase of the trial. Generally, it’s allowed to cover an issue raised during cross-examination of a witness.\n",
      "Closing arguments—Statements that organize the evidence and state the applicable law. The plaintiff’s attorney goes first and gets a rebuttal opportunity at the end, which should be limited to issues raised by the defense’s attorney.\n",
      "Jury instructions—The attorneys propose instructions to the jury on how to consider the evidence, and then the judge approves or disapproves; if the instructions are approved, the judge reads them to the jury.\n",
      "Providing Qualifications for Your Testimony\n",
      "During the qualification phase of your testimony, your attorney asks questions to elicit the qualifications that make you an expert witness. This qualification phase is called voir dire The qualification phase of testimony, in which an attorney asks questions to establish an expert witness’s credentials. The process of qualifying jurors is also called voir dire. (in French, literally “to see, to say”). Typically, your attorney guides you through your CV. The amount of detail in this examination depends on several factors, but they all relate to how much advantage the attorney sees in your qualifications. After your attorney has completed this examination, he or she asks the court to accept you as an expert on digital forensics. However, opposing counsel might object and is allowed to\n",
      "you as an expert on digital forensics. However, opposing counsel might object and is allowed to examine you, too; usually, cross-examination happens only if the opposing attorney thinks there’s something to gain from it.\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "If you know that the opposing expert witness taught or took a course that used a publication you wrote or co-authored, tell your attorney about it. He could emphasize that you’re the author and examine the opposing witness on this fact to give you more credibility as a recognized expert in the field.\n",
      "The following example is a short direct-examination voir dire:\n",
      "Q:\n",
      "Please state your name and spell your last name for the record.\n",
      "A:\n",
      "Wilma Nokiki, N-O-K-I-K-I.\n",
      "Q:\n",
      "What is your profession?\n",
      "A:\n",
      "I am a digital forensics examiner.\n",
      "Q:\n",
      "How long have you been a digital forensics examiner?\n",

      "Twelve years.\n",
      "Q:\n",
      "Where are you currently employed?\n",
      "A:\n",

Generally, your attorney bypasses that offer in favor of impressing the jury with your qualifications.\n",
      "General Guidelines on Testifying\n",
      "Whether you’re serving as an expert witness or a fact witness, be professional and polite when presenting yourself to any attorney or the court. Before the trial, try to learn the jury, judge, and other attorneys’ level of knowledge on and attitudes toward computers and technology. Talk to local attorneys to learn more about the type of people typically serving on local juries. With this knowledge, you can gauge your presentation to your audience’s educational level, and incorporate appropriate analogies into your explanations. Remember that the judge is well educated but not necessarily in the field of digital evidence. Jurors typically average around 12 years of education and an eighth-grade reading level. The attorneys might have a thorough background in the field, but you’re the expert\n",
      "reading level. The attorneys might have a thorough background in the field, but you’re the expert with experience. You could also be dealing with an arbiter or mediator who may or may not have a background in digital forensics.\n",
      "There are two responses you should be prepared to use often as a witness. First, if asked a question you can’t answer, respond by saying, “That is beyond the scope of my expertise” or “I was not asked to investigate that.” These statements make it clear that you understand your limitations. You won’t seem less of an expert for knowing and expressing your limitations. If anything, acknowledging your limitations enhances your standing with a jury. Second, if you don’t understand a question or find it confusing, simply say, “Can you please rephrase the question?” Typically, this response gets the attorney to reorganize the question and is one method you can use to control the pace and direction of the examination. If the question is stated awkwardly or you aren’t sure of the intent, ask the\n",
      "of the examination. If the question is stated awkwardly or you aren’t sure of the intent, ask the attorney for clarification.\n",
      "If opposing counsel tries to reframe your answer in a way that you don’t believe is accurate, reject his restatement by saying “No, that isn’t what I said,” and then restate your position accurately, starting with “What I said was.” Be respectful and even pleasant, but be firm.\n",
      "Another aspect of acknowledging your limitations is making sure you avoid overstating opinions. Part of what you have to deliver to the jury is a person they can trust to help them figure out something that’s beyond their expertise. Overstating an opinion creates the potential for the jury to mistrust or doubt you; like a teacher, you should admit your limitations and the limitations of your results.\n",
      "Your delivery is an important part of how you answer questions and affects the impact you have on the jury. The following list offers some general guidelines on delivery and presentation:\n",
      "Always acknowledge the jury and direct your testimony to them, using an enthusiastic, sincere tone to keep the jury interested in what you have to say. When an attorney or the judge asks you a question, turn toward the questioner, and then turn back to the jury to give the answer.\n",
      "If a microphone is present, place it 6 to 8 inches from you, and remember to speak loudly and clearly so that the jury can hear and understand you.\n",
      "Use simple, direct language to help the jury understand you. For example, use “test” instead of “analyze,” as in “I ran a test on the files I found.” Also, make sure you use specific, articulate speech when speaking; for clarity, avoid contractions and slang, unless you’re quoting a fact related to the case.\n",
      "Avoid humor. What one person thinks is funny, another won’t. In addition, limit your responses to what you perceive as attempts at humor from anybody else.\n",
      "Build repetition into your explanations and descriptions for the jury.\n",
      "Use chronological order to describe events when testifying, and use hand gestures to help the audience understand what you’re emphasizing. For example, point to graphics while talking. (Graphics are discussed more later in “Using Graphics During Testimony.”)\n",
      "If you’re using technical terms, identify and define these terms for the jury, using analogies and graphics as appropriate. List any important technical elements, showing how you verified and validated each element.\n",
      "When giving an opinion, cite the source of the evidence the opinion is based on. Then express your opinion and explain your methodology—how you arrived at your opinion.\n",
      "If the witness chair is adjustable, make sure the height is comfortable, and turn the chair so that it faces the jury.\n",
      "To enhance your image with the jury, dress in a manner conforming to the community’s dress code for business professionals, or dress like the attorneys in the case. If your testimony is being videotaped, avoid fine stripes in suits or ties because they can generate a strobing effect in video recordings under artificial light. Men should wear conservative ties with a base color of red; women should wear suits in conservative colors or a dress that allows freedom of movement.\n",
      "Don’t memorize your testimony; you should strive for a natural, extemporaneous tone. Also, make sure you have alternative ways to describe or explain key facts.\n",
      "For direct examinations, state your opinion, identify evidence to support your opinion, explain the method you used to arrive at your opinion from your analysis, and then restate your opinion.\n",
      "As mentioned, have definitions and explanations aimed at a nontechnical audience ready for technical terms you must use in your testimony. Learn how to describe the tools you use as a standardized process for your work. Make sure you’re knowledgeable about the fallibility of digital forensics so that you can resist counterattacks from opposing counsel. Lengthy explanations might be good for some jury cases but not for others, so seek your attorney’s opinion.\n",
      "Prepare your testimony with the attorney who hired you. The following are specific questions you should prepare for:\n",
      "How is data (or evidence) stored on a hard drive?\n",
      "What is an image or a bit-stream copy of a drive?\n",
      "How is deleted data recovered from a drive?\n",
      "What are Windows temporary files, and how are they related to data or evidence?\n",
      "What are system or network log files?\n",
      "Using Graphics During Testimony\n",
      "Graphical exhibits, such as charts and tables, illustrate and clarify your findings. As a general rule, memory retention is much weaker for audio material and stronger for visual material. Therefore, oral testimony supported by graphical presentations is an effective way to impart information and help your listeners retain it. Your exhibits must be clear and easy to understand. Graphics should be big, bold, and simple so that the jury can see them easily, and consider factors such as glare and adequate contrast to ensure easy visibility. If necessary, make smaller copies of graphics for jurors so that they can see details better.\n",
      "The goal of using graphics is to provide information the jury needs to know (such as how hardware and software work), an explanation of your findings, and the role the evidence plays in the case. Make sure each graphic conveys only one concept or point; don’t try to include too much information in a single graphic. If you’re using graphics to explain a complex technical concept or procedure, use two or more graphics, with the first graphic providing an overview.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Don’t include vendor logos on your charts, and don’t use charts created by someone else, unless you commissioned someone to create them or have documented permission to use them. In this way, you can avoid possible copyright issues. Another advantage of creating your own charts is you can make sure you’re comfortable with—and can explain—their content.\n",
      "Review all graphics with your attorney before trial, and make sure you’ve practiced using them so that you appear comfortable and confident. In most courts, you need at least three extra copies of your graphics: one for your attorney, one for the opposing attorney, and one for the judge. However, it’s the attorney’s responsibility to have graphical exhibits admitted into evidence.\n",
      "Courtrooms are becoming more audiovisual capable, and you might be able to use a projector system. If one is available, discuss using it with your attorney. You might also talk about the possibility of giving jurors copies of your presentation on removable storage media, such as a CD or a USB drive.\n",
      "Make sure the jury can see your graphics, and face the jury during your presentation. If your graphics haven’t been placed near the jury box, ask the judge if you can move them so that the jury can see them better. When you’re talking about specific areas of an illustration, use a pointer to direct jurors’ attention to details. You can also use your hands to help emphasize certain information or direct attention to specific points. Make sure any gestures are above the waist so that the jury can see them. If an attorney asks you questions as you explain the graphics, face the jury and answer the questions in full sentences.\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "When you’re standing in front of the jury, leave your jacket unbuttoned and keep your elbows bent to show that you’re comfortable, confident, and at ease.\n",
      "Avoiding Testimony Problems\n",
      "Although you should recognize when conflict-of-interest issues apply to your case and discuss any concerns with the attorney who hires you, be aware of a practice called conflicting out The practice of opposing attorneys trying to prevent you from testifying by claiming you have discussed the case with them and, therefore, have a conflict of interest. . It’s an attempt by opposing attorneys to prevent you from serving on an important case and is most common in the private sector when you work as an independent consultant. Opposing attorneys might call to discuss the case with you and then claim you can’t testify because of a conflict of interest caused by you discussing the case with another attorney besides the one who hired you. As a result, you might be excluded from working for an\n",
      "attorney besides the one who hired you. As a result, you might be excluded from working for an attorney needing your services. (The issue of conflict is raised by motion after witness lists are exchanged.)\n",
      "In addition, avoid agreeing to review a case unless you’re under contract with that person. Also, avoid conversations with opposing attorneys—there’s no such thing as an “off the record” conversation with opposing attorneys after you have been retained; refer them to the attorney who retained you. Have a fee agreement for your case review ready to e-mail or fax to opposing attorneys to protect yourself from this practice; this agreement serves as proof that they didn’t want to retain you. If you aren’t retained, you’re in a better position to collect a fee for the service you did provide, and it deters them from attempting to manufacture a conflict issue to disqualify you later as an expert witness.\n",
      "Early in direct examination, your attorney should ask whether you were hired to perform an analysis and testify. He or she might ask how much you charged for your services and whether you have already been paid; you should receive payment before testifying. If you haven’t been paid, it might seem that you have a contingent interest in the litigation—that your payment depends on the resolution of the case. Fees and payment schedules are appropriate subjects for examination, although the judge might limit these questions. If your attorney doesn’t ask you questions about payment, the opposing counsel could examine you on it in an effort to discredit you or lessen your credibility as a witness. However, the opposing counsel knows that this tactic might be used on his expert witnesses, too, so\n",
      "However, the opposing counsel knows that this tactic might be used on his expert witnesses, too, so he might touch on the subject but not dwell on it, unless you say you haven’t been paid completely.\n",
      "When you’re testifying, don’t talk to anyone during court recess. If the opposing attorney sees you having a conversation with anyone, including the attorney who retained you, he or she could cross-examine you again and demand that you explain and repeat your conversation. However, be aware that your attorney might want to notify you of updates during breaks, so make sure you conduct any conferences in a private setting. If a juror approaches and says anything to you, decline to talk with him or her and promptly report the contact to the attorney who retained you. This event must be reported to the court.\n",
      "Understanding Prosecutorial Misconduct\n",
      "If you’re working for a prosecutor in a criminal case and believe you have found exculpatory evidence (evidence that exonerates or diminishes the defendant’s liability), you have an obligation to ensure that the evidence isn’t concealed. Initially, you should report the evidence (emphasizing its exculpatory nature) to the prosecutor handling the case. Be sure you document communicating your concern to the prosecutor. If this information isn’t disclosed to the defense attorney in a reasonable time, you can report it to the prosecutor’s supervisor. Be sure to document this communication, too. Documentation of each attempt to induce disclosure and your reasoning is important to protect your reputation.\n",
      "If these efforts still don’t result in disclosure, you can report the lack of disclosure to the judge. Be sure you have documented your attempts to bring the matter to the prosecutor’s attention before bringing it to the judge. Don’t communicate directly with the defense attorney; reporting evidence to the judge fulfills your obligation. The rules that apply to defense expert witnesses are different.\n",
      "Testifying During Direct Examination\n",
      "You provide direct testimony when you answer questions from the attorney who hired you. This direct examination is the most important part of testimony at a trial. Cross-examination is not as important, even if the opposing attorney is attempting to discredit you.\n",
      "When preparing your testimony for direct examination, keep some guidelines and techniques in mind. You should work with your attorney to get the right language that communicates your message to the jury effectively. Also, your attorney might advise you to be wary of your inclination to be helpful. This trait is natural, but it can hurt your testimony. You shouldn’t volunteer any information or be overly friendly (or hostile) to the opposing attorney.\n",
      "Review the examination plan your attorney has prepared to see whether you can make any suggestions for improvement; this plan is structured to ensure that questions elicit relevant evidence during direct examination. Make sure you’ve prepared a clear overview of your findings and have a systematic and easy-to-follow plan for describing your evidence-collection methods. Practice testifying with your graphics so that you’re comfortable using them.\n",
      "Your attorney might also help you develop a theme to follow when presenting your testimony, but make sure you use your own words when answering questions. Generally, the best approach your attorney can take in direct examination is to ask you open-ended questions and let you give your testimony.\n",
      "In addition, make sure you know the following terms before giving testimony because your attorney will likely use them during the direct examination:\n",
      "Independent recollection—Information you know about this case and others without being prompted\n",
      "Customary practice—Procedures that are traditionally followed in similar cases\n",
      "Documentation of the case—The written records you have maintained\n",
      "When your attorney questions you about your background and qualifications, your answers should show why you are an expert able to give testimony. Give answers that emphasize your factual findings and opinions. Remember to tailor your language to the jury’s educational level, and try to strike a balance between technical language and layperson language when describing complex matters.\n",
      "Avoid vagueness in your wording choices, too. For example, don’t use expressions such as “very large” or “a long time.” The meaning of these expressions varies, depending on what they’re compared with, and this comparison might be different for every juror. Use precise numbers and units of measurement, and if relevant, cite numbers’ statistical position, relationship to the mean, or an expected value or range.\n",
      "When you’re using graphics in a presentation, keep in mind that you’re instructing the jury in what you did to collect evidence, so follow some of the same guidelines teachers use in a classroom to make sure the jury understands your explanations.\n",
      "Testifying During Cross-Examination\n",
      "When answering questions from the opposing attorney, use your own words. Keep in mind that certain words have additional meanings that an opposing attorney can exploit. For example, the word “suspicious” is more value laden than the more neutral “concerned.”\n",
      "Be aware of leading questions from the opposing attorney, too. An ambiguous question—such as “Isn’t it true that forensics experts always destroy their handwritten notes?,”—is an attempt to lead you to say something that could be construed as wrong. (The answer to that question should be “I don’t know.”) Leading questions call for yes or no answers and are sometimes referred to as “setup questions”—setting you up for a response that could be damaging to your client’s case. They’re often phrased in a complex structure, designed to limit your freedom in answering. Getting to the real question opposing counsel is asking might take many questions.\n",
      "If opposing attorneys ask you a question such as “Did you use more than one tool to verify the evidence?” they’re checking to make sure you validated the findings from one tool by using another tool. Opposing attorneys often ask the following questions, too:\n",
      "What tools did you use, and what are their known problems or weaknesses?\n",
      "Are the tools you used reliable? Are they consistent, and do they produce the same results?\n",
      "Have other professionals called on you as a consultant on how to use tools?\n",
      "Do you keep up with the latest technologies used in digital forensics, such as by reading journal articles?\n",
      "During examinations, lawyers aren’t supposed to ask another question until you have finished answering the current question. However, the opposing counsel sometimes uses rapid-fire questions during cross-examination that are meant to throw you off. Taking a moment to turn toward the jury before you answer gives you more control over the timing and speed of the opposing attorney’s examination. Even though your attorney should object by saying, “Counsel has not allowed the witness to answer the question,” don’t be afraid to regroup and restate your answers if you get confused during your testimony. Jurors will sympathize because often they’re confused by the opposing attorney’s questions, too.\n",
      "If the opposing attorney declares that you aren’t answering the questions, she could be making an attempt to get you to change your testimony. You aren’t giving the answer she wants, or she’s attempting to get you to say something that contradicts part of your previous testimony. Don’t take this attempt personally, but think carefully about what the opposing attorney is trying to do.\n",
      "During a jury trial, keep a comfortable level of eye contact with the jury. You might find yourself competing with the opposing attorney, but do your best to keep the jury’s attention on you during your testimony. As the opposing attorney asks you questions, avoid strict yes or no answers, if possible; add facts to clarify your answer, when appropriate, before the opposing attorney can hit you with a “killer question.” This type of question, contrived based on a change in a basic underlying fact, is one that you seemingly can’t answer or deny. It can derail your testimony and your client’s case; however, the judge will usually support you in stating conditions or limits. The most effective process for success in cross-examination is to establish the hypothetical facts that are the basis of\n",
      "for success in cross-examination is to establish the hypothetical facts that are the basis of your opinion. Hypothetical facts should be based on evidence presented at trial as well as stipulations and standard facts that all professional digital forensics examiners rely on, such as the fact that a kilobyte is composed of 1024 bytes.\n",
      "On some occasions, you have to bring in another examiner or agency to collect more evidence because of the nature of the case. As an examiner working on a civil case, for example, sometimes you need to hand off evidence you have gathered to another company’s security group or a government agency to develop the case further. Consult with your supervisor or the party who retained you to determine the correct procedure.\n",
      "Sometimes opposing attorneys ask several questions inside one question; this practice is called a compound question, and your attorney should object to it. If your attorney doesn’t, you can respond by saying, “Could you please break your last question into separate questions?” Another tactic opposing attorneys use in cross-examinations is to make a speech and phrase it as a question. You have no obligation to respond to statements by opposing counsel. The judge usually catches this error, and your attorney should also object. Other methods opposing attorneys use to challenge your credibility are putting words in your mouth and summarizing your testimony to fit their needs, creating assumptions or speculation, and controlling the pace of your testimony. Other tactics are stating minor\n",
      "or speculation, and controlling the pace of your testimony. Other tactics are stating minor inconsistencies that cause you to make conflicting statements and encouraging you to volunteer information.\n",
      "Your response to cross-examination tactics should challenge the opposing attorney to be more sensible, a response that often plays well with juries. Take your time answering questions. Be thoughtful, professional, and courteous in your responses. The more patient you are during cross-examination, the better you’ll weather any possible attacks. If the opposing attorney becomes assertive or upset with your testimony, be as professional and courteous as possible. If he continues to lose control, staying calm and professional strengthens your image by comparison. Responding to a question with a sentence that communicates limitations or qualifications might be important, if a simple yes or no doesn’t answer the question completely and accurately. If you need to have your attorney expand a line\n",
      "answer the question completely and accurately. If you need to have your attorney expand a line of questions on redirect, have an agreed-on expression you can use to signal him, such as “This question requires a more complex answer, but the short answer is yes (or no).”\n",
      "In addition to direct examination and cross-examination, most jurisdictions now allow the judge and jurors to ask questions. These questions are subject to the same rules of evidence that any other question is. Attorneys can object to these questions but generally won’t unless they are an especially serious breach of the rules, such as a question that was specifically excluded in a motion in limine. Answering a question from the judge or a juror should be viewed as an opportunity. As a witness, you usually have to guess at what’s important to the judge and jury, but you don’t when responding to a question directly from them.\n",
      "Many factors contribute to your stress when testifying, including the judge, the attorneys, the jury, and the feeling of losing control. Don’t think you’re responsible for the outcome. If you make a mistake, correct it, and get back on track with your testimony. You should avoid showing that you have lost control, such as by the following behaviors:\n",
      "Being argumentative when being badgered by the opposing attorney or being nervous about testifying\n",
      "Having poor listening skills or defensive body language, such as crossing your arms\n",
      "Being too talkative or talking too fast when answering questions\n",
      "Being too technical for an ordinary juror to understand your testimony\n",
      "Acting surprised and unprepared to respond when presented with unknown or new information\n",
      "Never have unrealistically high self-expectations when testifying; everyone makes mistakes. Who controls the testimony is the most important part for the attorney, in both direct examination and cross-examination. The key to successful cross-examination is to continue selling yourself to the jury, no matter how much the opposing attorney tries to discredit you or your testimony. In addition, remember that for every expert witness, there’s a first time testifying. Good technical credentials and related experience are the most effective defense against cross-examination voir dire when testifying. You should also remember that the number of times you’ve testified isn’t a condition of qualifying as an expert witness.\n",
      "Preparing for a Deposition or Hearing\n",
      "A deposition A formal examination in which you’re questioned under oath with only the opposing parties, your attorney, and a court reporter present. There’s no judge or jury. Its purpose is to give the opposing counsel a chance to preview testimony before trial. differs from trial testimony because there’s no jury or judge. Both attorneys are present and ask you questions. (With current technology, the concept of “present” is expanding to include “virtually present.”) The purpose of the deposition is for the opposing attorney to preview your testimony before trial. The attorney who requests a deposition usually establishes its location, which might be in his or her office or your forensics laboratory.\n",
      "There are two types of depositions: discovery and testimony preservation. A discovery deposition The opposing attorney sets this deposition and often conducts the equivalent of both direct and cross-examination; it’s considered part of the discovery process. See also deposition. is part of the discovery process for trial. The opposing attorney who requested the deposition often conducts the equivalent of a direct examination and a cross-examination. Your attorney usually asks only questions needed to clarify a point that could be subject to misinterpretation in your direct testimony. Although a discovery deposition can be video recorded, a written transcript is more common and is required in addition to the video recording. If the deposition is video recorded, court rules generally require\n",
      "addition to the video recording. If the deposition is video recorded, court rules generally require a longer notice period to schedule it than a stenographically recorded one.\n",

See also deposition. is usually requested by your client to preserve your testimony in case of schedule conflicts or health problems. These depositions are often video recorded in addition to the written transcript, and your testimony is entered by playing the video recording for the jury. In some cases, you can set the deposition at your laboratory or have lab facilities available, which can make it easier to conduct demonstrations and produce better testimony. This deposition follows the pattern of trial testimony, with your attorney calling you as a witness and conducting a direct examination,\n",
      "trial testimony, with your attorney calling you as a witness and conducting a direct examination, opposing counsel conducting cross-examination, and the attorneys conducting redirect and recross examination, if necessary. The judge rules on objections and, based on objections that are sustained, decides which portions of the testimony are omitted from the copy presented to the jury.\n",
      "Guidelines for Testifying at Depositions\n",
      "Often attorneys are more combative during discovery depositions than they are during trial (or video-recorded depositions). For this reason, a deposition can be more stressful than trial testimony. Therefore, strive to stay calm and convey a relaxed, confident appearance during a deposition. For example, try to keep your hands on top of the table, and make sure your chair is at the right height to avoid sitting below the opposing attorney’s eye level. Maintain a professional demeanor and try not to be influenced by the opposing attorney’s tone, expression, or tactics. Learn the opposing attorney’s name before the deposition and include it in your responses to project a sense of equality in position between you and the opposing attorney. Look the opposing attorney directly in the eyes, even\n",
      "between you and the opposing attorney. Look the opposing attorney directly in the eyes, even if she attempts to avoid eye contact.\n",
      "Remember that during a deposition, opposing attorneys use all the techniques available to them at trial, so keep the guidelines for testimony in mind when answering questions, and be assertive in your responses. If you’re particularly concerned about the deposition, ask your attorney to record a practice session, and then evaluate your performance. Here are some general rules to follow during depositions:\n",
      "Be professional and polite.\n",
      "Use facts when describing your opinion.\n",
      "Understand that being deposed in a discovery deposition is an unnatural process; it’s intended to get you to make mistakes.\n",
      "If you prepared a written report, the opposing attorney might attempt to use it against you by leading you to testify contrary to what you had previously written. If the attorney is concealing the report or any other document from your view, ask to see the document. When the opposing attorney asks you about something specific in your written report, ask what page number he’s referring to. If you don’t have the report in your hands, you can ask to review it.\n",
      "If your attorney objects to a question from the opposing attorney, pause and think of what direction your attorney might want you to go in your answer. Keep your answers short and simple. Strive for a relaxed, friendly demeanor, especially if you’re being recorded. To gain time and control, ask the opposing attorney questions to clarify what he’s asking for, such as asking him to repeat the question.\n",
      "Be prepared at the end of a deposition to spell any specialized or technical words you used. To aid court reporters, give them a list of technical or scientific words you use often, including definitions and correct spellings.\n",
      "Recognizing Deposition Problems\n",
      "Discuss any potential problems with your attorney before the deposition. Identify anything that might affect your client negatively and could be used by opposing counsel. If you don’t disclose this information, the opposing attorney might be aware of it and use it against you in court. Be prepared to defend yourself if there are problems. The following guidelines can also help you avoid problems during depositions:\n",
      "Avoid omitting information in your testimony; omissions can cause major problems. Although you don’t have to volunteer more information than an attorney asks for, make sure you’re telling the truth at all times.\n",
      "To respond to difficult questions that could jeopardize your client’s case, pause before answering, allowing your attorney to object before you answer.\n",
      "To avoid having the opposing attorney box you into a corner or lead you to contradict previous statements, answer only the questions you’re asked, using short answers that are narrow in scope when possible.\n",
      "Realize that excessively detailed questions from opposing counsel are an attempt to get you to contradict yourself. Avoid trying to educate the opposing attorney, especially if the questions seem to be beyond the scope of your expertise or the questions you were retained to answer. Feel free to give answers such as “I don’t know” or “I don’t understand.”\n",
      "When asked whether you know about an opposing fact or expert witness, your response should be as professional as possible. A good standard answer is “I have heard Mr. Smith is a competent examiner, but I have not reviewed the body of his work.” If you have specific and verifiable information that’s damaging to the opposing expert’s reputation, you can note it, but do it in an understated manner. This technique emphasizes your professional demeanor, especially if you have negative information about the opposing expert’s skills or competency.\n",
      "Keep in mind that you can correct any minor errors you make during your examination by referring back to the error and correcting it. You also have an opportunity after the deposition, but you have to ask for it. You’ll be asked at the end of the deposition if you waive signature; if you want to review the deposition, you shouldn’t waive signature because you then get a chance to review, make corrections on the corrections page, and sign the deposition.\n",
      "Discovery deposition testimony generally doesn’t make it to the jury, except for the purpose of showing previous inconsistent testimony by the witness. This process is called “publishing the deposition.” The witness can then be examined about inconsistent testimony in the deposition.\n",
      "Guidelines for Testifying at Hearings\n",
      "Testifying at a hearing is generally comparable to testifying at a trial, so follow the same general guidelines you would for courtroom testimony. A hearing can be before an administrative agency or a legislative body or in a court (when it typically addresses specific issues). An administrative or legislative hearing generally addresses the agency’s or committee’s subject matter and seeks evidence in your testimony on a subject for which it’s contemplating making a rule or legislation. A presiding officer or committee chairperson is present, and the format of questioning depends on the agency’s or committee’s rules and the purpose of the hearing. Often administrative or legislative hearings are related to events that previously resulted in litigation. Testifying at administrative hearings\n",
      "are related to events that previously resulted in litigation. Testifying at administrative hearings isn’t as common as testifying in depositions or at trials.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "The federal government has thousands of administrative agencies, and states often have hundreds of administrative agencies.\n",
      "A judicial hearing is held in court to determine the admissibility of certain evidence before trial. No jury is present, but evidentiary suppression hearings are usually held early in the case to determine whether a criminal case moves forward or is dismissed. Generally, they focus more on your procedure in obtaining and preserving evidence than on the substance of the evidence or your opinion. They can also include the basis or authority (warrant or probable cause) for you conducting the examination. In most criminal cases, the defense attorney seeks to suppress any evidence for which there’s an arguable basis for rejection.\n",

      "Chapter Summary\n",
      "When cases go to trial, you as the forensics expert play one of two roles: a fact witness or an expert witness. As a fact witness, you’re providing only the facts you discovered in your investigation. However, as an expert witness, you have opinions about what you have observed. In fact, it’s your opinion that makes you an expert witness.\n",
      "If you’re called as a fact witness or an expert witness in a digital forensics case, you need to prepare for your testimony thoroughly. Establish communication early with your attorney. Substantiate your findings with your own documentation and by collaborating with other digital forensics professionals.\n",
      "When you’re called to testify in court, your attorney examines you on your qualifications to establish your competency as an expert witness or a fact witness. Opposing counsel might attempt to discredit you based on your past record. Your attorney then leads you through the evidence, followed by the opposing counsel cross-examining you. Redirect examinations and recross examinations of limited scope might follow.\n",
      "Make sure you’re prepared for questions opposing counsel might use to discredit you, confuse you, or throw you off the track. Stay calm and project professionalism in your behavior and appearance.\n",
      "Know whether you’re being called as a fact witness or an expert witness (or both) and whether you’re being retained as a consulting expert or expert witness. Also, be familiar with the contents of your curriculum vitae.\n",
      "A deposition differs from a trial because there’s no jury or judge. Both attorneys and a court reporter are present, and the attorney asks you questions. There are two types of depositions: discovery and testimony preservation. Testimony preservation depositions are often recorded.\n",
      "Hearings are typically administrative hearings or judicial hearings. Guidelines for testifying at depositions and hearings are much the same as the guidelines for courtroom testimony. Keep in mind that attorneys at discovery depositions might be more combative, so striving to maintain a calm, professional appearance can be critical. Discovery depositions are designed to elicit relevant evidence or testimony that might lead to relevant evidence, so the capacity to object effectively is very limited.\n",
      "Make sure you prepare answers for questions on what steps you took to collect and analyze evidence and questions on what tools you used and how they work.\n",

      "Describe the field of digital forensics\n",
      "Explain how to prepare for computer investigations and summarize the difference between public-sector and private-sector investigations\n",

      "Describe procedures for private-sector digital investigations\n",
      "Explain requirements for data recovery workstations and software\n",
      "Summarize how to conduct an investigation, including critiquing a case\n",
      "In the past several years, the field of computer forensics has developed significantly, including new terminology. This chapter introduces you to computer forensics or, as it’s now typically called, digital forensics and discusses issues of importance in the industry. This book blends traditional investigative methods with classic systems analysis problem-solving techniques and applies them to investigations involving computers and other digital media and systems. Understanding these disciplines combined with the use of the forensics tools will make you a skilled digital forensics examiner.\n",
      "This chapter also gives you an overview of how to manage a digital investigation and use standard problem-solving techniques. You learn about the problems and challenges forensics examiners face when preparing and processing investigations, including the ideas and questions they must consider. To perform the activities and projects in this chapter, you work with forensic disk images from small USB drives and then can apply the same techniques to a large disk.\n",
      "An Overview of Digital Forensics\n",
      "As the world has become more of a level playing field, with more people online who have access to the same information (Thomas L. Freidman, The World Is Flat, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2005), the need to standardize digital forensics processes has become more urgent. The definition of digital forensics Applying investigative procedures for a legal purpose; involves the analysis of digital evidence as well as obtaining search warrants, maintaining a chain of custody, validating with mathematical hash functions, using validated tools, ensuring repeatability, reporting, and presenting evidence as an expert witness. has also evolved over the years from simply involving securing and analyzing digital information stored on a computer for use as evidence in civil, criminal, or administrative\n",
      "digital information stored on a computer for use as evidence in civil, criminal, or administrative cases. The former director of the Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory, Ken Zatyko, wrote a treatise on the many specialties including computer forensics, network forensics, video forensics, and a host of others. He defined it as “[t]he application of computer science and investigative procedures for a legal purpose involving the analysis of digital evidence (information of probative value that is stored or transmitted in binary form) after proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics (hash function), use of validated tools, repeatability, reporting and possible expert presentation” (“Commentary: Defining Digital Forensics,” Forensic Magazine, 2007).\n",
      "The field of digital forensics can also encompass items such as research and incident response. With incident response, most organizations are concerned with protecting their assets and containing the situation, not necessarily prosecuting or finding the person responsible. Research in digital forensics also isn’t concerned with prosecution or validity of evidence. This book is intended for digital forensics investigators and examiners at the civil, criminal, and administrative levels. Other facets of digital forensics are beyond the scope of this book. Keep in mind that depending on the jurisdiction and situation, forensic investigators and examiners might be the same or different personnel. In this book, the terms are used interchangeably.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "For a more in-depth discussion of what the term “digital forensics” means, see “Digital Forensic Evidence Examination” (Fred Cohen, www.fredcohen.net/Books/2013-DFE-Examination.pdf, 2012).\n",
      "Many groups have tried to create digital forensics certifications that could be recognized worldwide but have failed in this attempt. However, they have created certifications for specific categories of practitioners, such as government investigators. With the ubiquitous access to mobile devices now, digital evidence is everywhere, so the need for a global standardized method is even more critical so that companies and governments can share and use digital evidence. In October 2012, an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for digital forensics was ratified. This standard, ISO 27037 “Information technology – Security techniques – Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence” (see www.iso.org/standard/44381.html),\n",
      "acquisition and preservation of digital evidence” (see www.iso.org/standard/44381.html), defines the personnel and methods for acquiring and preserving digital evidence. To address the multinational cases that continue to emerge, agencies in every country should develop policies and procedures that meet this standard.\n",
      "The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), signed into law in 1973, was created to ensure consistency in federal proceedings, but many states’ rules map to the FRE, too. In another attempt to standardize procedures, the FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) was formed in 1984 to handle the increase in cases involving digital evidence. By the late 1990s, CART had teamed up with the Department of Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL) for research and training. Much of the early curriculum in this field came from the DCFL. For more information on the FBI’s cybercrime investigation services, see www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber.\n",
      "Files maintained on a computer are covered by different rules, depending on the nature of the documents. Many court cases in state and federal courts have developed and clarified how the rules apply to digital evidence. The Fourth Amendment The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in the Bill of Rights dictates that the government and its agents must have probable cause for search and seizure. to the U.S. Constitution (and each state’s constitution) protects everyone’s right to be secure in their person, residence, and property from search and seizure. Continuing development of the jurisprudence of this amendment has played a role in determining whether the search for digital evidence has established a different precedent, so separate search warrants Legal documents that allow law\n",
      "has established a different precedent, so separate search warrants Legal documents that allow law enforcement to search an office, a home, or other locale for evidence related to an alleged crime. might not be necessary. However, when preparing to search for evidence in a criminal case, many investigators still include the suspect’s computer and its components in the search warrant to avoid later admissibility problems.\n",
      "In an important case involving these issues, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court addressed expectations of privacy and whether evidence is admissible (see Commonwealth v. Copenhefer, 587 A.2d 1353, 526 Pa. 555 [1991]). Initial investigations by the FBI, state police, and local police resulted in discovering computer-generated notes and instructions—some of which had been deleted—that had been concealed in hiding places around Corry, Pennsylvania. The investigation also produced several possible suspects, including David Copenhefer, who owned a nearby bookstore and apparently had bad relationships with the victim and her husband. Examination of trash discarded from Copenhefer’s store revealed drafts of the ransom note and directions. Subsequent search warrants resulted in seizure of evidence\n",
      "of the ransom note and directions. Subsequent search warrants resulted in seizure of evidence against him. Copenhefer’s computer contained several drafts and amendments of the text of phone calls to the victim and the victim’s husband the next day, the ransom note, the series of hidden notes, and a plan for the entire kidnapping scheme (Copenhefer, p. 559).\n",
      "On direct appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the physical evidence, including the digital forensics evidence, was sufficient to support the bookstore owner’s conviction. Copenhefer’s argument was that “[E]ven though his computer was validly seized pursuant to a warrant, his attempted deletion of the documents in question created an expectation of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment. Thus, he claims, under Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), and its progeny, Agent Johnson’s retrieval of the documents, without first obtaining another search warrant, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and the documents thus seized should have been suppressed” (Copenhefer, p. 561).\n",
      "The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected this argument, stating, “A defendant’s attempt to secrete evidence of a crime is not synonymous with a legally cognizable expectation of privacy. A mere hope for secrecy is not a legally protected expectation. If it were, search warrants would be required in a vast number of cases where warrants are clearly not necessary” (Copenhefer, p. 562).\n",
      "Every U.S. jurisdiction has case law related to the admissibility of evidence recovered from computers and other digital devices. As you learn in this book, however, the laws on digital evidence vary between states as well as between provinces and countries.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice offers a useful guide to search and seizure procedures for computers and computer evidence at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aabb/8b0caf982a0aa211f932252af38d4c9376fb.pdf.\n",
      "Digital Forensics and Other Related Disciplines\n",
      "According to DIBS USA, Inc., a privately owned corporation specializing in digital forensics since the 1990s (www.dibsforensics.com), digital forensics involves scientifically examining and analyzing data from computer storage media so that it can be used as evidence in court. In the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) document “Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response” (http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-86.pdf, 2006), digital forensics is defined as “the application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data.” Typically, investigating digital devices includes collecting data\n",
      "chain of custody for the data.” Typically, investigating digital devices includes collecting data securely, examining suspect data to determine details such as origin and content, presenting digital information to courts, and applying laws to digital device practices.\n",
      "In general, digital forensics is used to investigate data that can be retrieved from a computer’s hard drive or other storage media. Like an archaeologist excavating a site, digital forensics examiners retrieve information from a computer or its components. The information retrieved might already be on the drive, but it might not be easy to find or decipher. On the other hand, network forensics yields information about how attackers gain access to a network along with files they might have copied, examined, or tampered with. Network forensics examiners use log files to determine when users logged on and determine which URLs users accessed, how they logged on to the network, and from what location. Network forensics also tries to determine what tracks or new files were left behind on a\n",
      "location. Network forensics also tries to determine what tracks or new files were left behind on a victim’s computer and what changes were made. In Chapter 10, you explore when and how network forensics should be used in an investigation.\n",
      "Digital forensics is also different from data recovery Retrieving files that were deleted accidentally or purposefully. , which involves retrieving information that was deleted by mistake or lost during a power surge or server crash, for example. In data recovery, typically you know what you’re looking for. Digital forensics is the task of recovering data that users have hidden or deleted, with the goal of ensuring that the recovered data is valid so that it can be used as evidence. In this regard, digital forensics differs from other types of evidence recovered from a scene. When investigators in a crime scene unit retrieve blood or hair or bullets, they can identify what it is. When a laptop, smartphone, or other digital device is retrieved, its contents are unknown and pose a challenge\n",
      "smartphone, or other digital device is retrieved, its contents are unknown and pose a challenge to the examiner. The evidence can be inculpatory evidence Evidence that indicates a suspect is guilty of the crime he or she is charged with. (in criminal cases, the expression is “incriminating”) or exculpatory evidence Evidence that indicates the suspect is innocent of the crime. , meaning it tends to clear the suspect. Examiners often approach a digital device not knowing whether it contains evidence. They must search storage media and piece together any data they find. Forensics software tools can be used for most cases. In extreme cases, examiners can use electron microscopes and other sophisticated equipment to retrieve information from machines that have been damaged or reformatted\n",
      "sophisticated equipment to retrieve information from machines that have been damaged or reformatted purposefully. This method is usually cost prohibitive, so it’s not normally used.\n",
      "Forensics investigators often work as part of a team to secure an organization’s computers and networks. The digital investigation function can be viewed as part of a triad that makes up computing security. Rapid progress in technology has resulted in an expansion of the skills needed and varies depending on the organization using practitioners in this field. Figure 1-1 shows the investigations triad made up of these functions:\n",
      "Vulnerability/threat assessment and risk management\n",
      "Network intrusion detection and incident response\n",
      "Digital investigations\n",
      "Each side of the triad in Figure 1-1 represents a group or department responsible for performing the associated tasks. Although each function operates independently, all three groups draw from one another when a large-scale digital investigation is being conducted. By combining these three groups into a team, all aspects of a digital technology investigation can be addressed without calling in outside specialists. In smaller companies, one group might perform all the tasks shown in the investigations triad, or a small company might contract with service providers to perform these tasks.\n",
      "When you work in the vulnerability/threat assessment and risk management The group that determines the weakest points in a system. It covers physical security and the security of OSs and applications. group, you test and verify the integrity of stand-alone workstations and network servers. This integrity check covers the physical security of systems and the security of operating systems (OSs) and applications. People working in this group (often known as penetration testers) test for vulnerabilities of OSs and applications used in the network and conduct authorized attacks on the network to assess vulnerabilities. Typically, people performing this task have several years of experience in system administration. Their job is to poke holes in the network to help an organization be better\n",

This group detects intruder attacks by using automated tools and monitoring network firewall logs. When an external attack is detected, the response team tracks, locates, and identifies the intrusion method and denies further access to the network.

      "A Brief History of Digital Forensics\n",
      "Fifty years ago, few people imagined that computers would be an integral part of everyday life. Now computer technology is commonplace, as are crimes in which a digital device is the instrument of the crime, the target of the crime, and, by its nature, the location where evidence is stored.\n",
      "By the 1970s, electronic crimes were increasing, especially in the financial sector. Most computers in that era were mainframes, used by trained people with specialized skills who worked in finance, engineering, and academia. White-collar fraud began when people in these industries saw a way to make money by manipulating computer data. One of the most well-known crimes of the mainframe era is the one-half cent crime. Banks commonly tracked money in accounts to the third decimal place or more. They used and still use the rounding-up accounting method when paying interest. If the interest applied to an account resulted in a fraction of a cent, that fraction was used in the calculation for the next account until the total resulted in a whole cent. It was assumed that eventually every customer\n",
      "account until the total resulted in a whole cent. It was assumed that eventually every customer would benefit from this averaging. Some computer programmers corrupted this method by opening an account for themselves and writing programs that diverted all the fractional monies into their accounts. In small banks, this practice amounted to only a few hundred dollars a month. In large banks with millions of accounts, however, the amount could reach hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n",
      "During this time, most law enforcement officers didn’t know enough about computers to ask the right questions or to preserve evidence for trial. Many began to attend Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) programs designed to train law enforcement in handling digital data.\n",
      "As PCs gained popularity and began to replace mainframe computers in the 1980s, many different OSs emerged. Apple released the Apple IIe in 1983 and then the Macintosh in 1984. Computers such as the TRS-80 and Commodore 64 were the machines of the day. CP/M machines, such as the Kaypro and Zenith, were also in demand.\n",
      "Disk Operating System (DOS) was available in many varieties, including PC-DOS, QDOS, DR-DOS, IBM-DOS, and MS-DOS. Forensics tools at that time were simple, and most were generated by government agencies, such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP, which had its own investigative tools) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Most tools were written in C and assembly language and weren’t available to the general public.\n",
      "In the mid-1980s, a new tool, Xtree Gold, appeared on the market. It recognized file types and retrieved lost or deleted files. Norton DiskEdit soon followed and became the preferred tool for finding and recovering deleted files. You could use these tools on the most powerful PCs of that time; IBM-compatible computers had hard disks of 10 to 40 MB and two floppy drives, as shown in Figure 1-2.\n",
      "In 1987, Apple produced the Mac SE, a Macintosh with an external EasyDrive hard disk with 60 MB of storage (see Figure 1-3). At this time, the popular Commodore 64 still used standard audiotapes to record data, so the Mac SE represented an important advance in computer technology.\n",
      "By the early 1990s, specialized tools for digital forensics were available. The International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS) An organization created to provide training and software for law enforcement in the digital forensics field. introduced training on software for digital forensics examinations, and the IRS created search-warrant programs. However, no commercial GUI software for digital forensics was available until ASR Data created Expert Witness for Macintosh. This software could recover deleted files and fragments of deleted files. One of the ASR Data partners later left and developed EnCase, which became a popular digital forensics tool.\n",
      "As computer technology continued to evolve, more digital forensics software was developed. The introduction of large hard disks posed new problems for investigators. Most DOS-based software didn’t recognize a hard disk larger than 8 GB. Because contemporary computers have hard disks of 500 GB and often much larger, changes in forensics software were needed. Later in this book, you explore the challenges of examining older software and hardware.\n",
      "Other tools, such as ILook, which is currently maintained by the IRS Criminal Investigation Division and limited to law enforcement, can analyze and read special files that are copies of a disk. AccessData Forensic Toolkit (FTK) has become a popular commercial product that performs similar tasks in the law enforcement and civilian markets.\n",
      "As software companies become savvier about digital forensics and investigations, they are producing more forensics tools to keep pace with technology. This book describes several tools but by no means all available tools. You should refer to trade publications, e-zines, and Web sites to stay current.\n",
      "Understanding Case Law\n",
      "Existing laws and statutes simply can’t keep up with the rate of technological change. Therefore, when statutes or regulations don’t exist, case law is used. In common law nations, such as the United States, case law allows legal counsel to apply previous similar cases to current ones in an effort to address ambiguity in laws. Examiners must be familiar with recent court rulings on search and seizure in the electronic environment to avoid mistakes such as exceeding a search warrant’s authority. Recent events involving privacy incursions by government agencies have resulted in new laws and policies. Developments in technology have changed how everyday events are viewed. For example, what should be considered private conversations? Which devices are actually protected?\n",
      "Although law enforcement can certainly confiscate anything an arrested person is carrying and log that a device, such as a smartphone, was on the person, they don’t necessarily have the right or authority to search the device. These actions are being challenged in courts constantly. Remaining vigilant in keeping up with changing case law is critical to being an effective digital forensics investigator.\n",
      "Developing Digital Forensics Resources\n",
      "To be a successful digital forensics investigator, you must be familiar with more than one computing platform. In addition to older platforms, such as DOS, Windows 9x, and Windows XP, you should be familiar with Linux, macOS, and current Windows platforms. However, no one can be an expert in every aspect of computing. Likewise, you can’t know everything about the technology you’re investigating. To supplement your knowledge, you should develop and maintain contact with digital, network, and investigative professionals.\n",
      "Join computer user groups in both the public and private sectors. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, Computer Technology Investigators Network (CTIN) A nonprofit group based in Seattle-Tacoma, WA, composed of law enforcement members, private corporation security professionals, and other security professionals whose aim is to improve the quality of high-technology investigations in the Pacific Northwest. meets to discuss problems that digital forensics examiners encounter. This nonprofit organization also conducts training. IACIS is an excellent group for law enforcement personnel but doesn’t have local chapters. However, groups such as the High Technology Crime Investigation Association, International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC)2, and InfraGard have\n",
      "International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC)2, and InfraGard have local chapters open to professionals in most major cities. Build your own network of digital forensics experts, and keep in touch through e-mail. Cultivate professional relationships with people who specialize in technical areas different from your own specialty. If you’re a Windows expert, for example, maintain contact with experts in Linux, UNIX, and macOS. If you’re using social media to interact with experts, exercise caution and good judgment when communicating with people you haven’t met in person or whose backgrounds you don’t know.\n",
      "User groups can be especially helpful when you need information about obscure OSs. For example, a user group helped convict a child molester in Pierce County, Washington, in 1996. The suspect installed video cameras throughout his house, served alcohol to young women to intoxicate them, and secretly filmed them playing strip poker. When he was accused of molesting a child, police seized his computers and other physical evidence. The investigator discovered that the computers used CoCo DOS, an OS that had been out of use for years. The investigator contacted a local user group, which supplied the standard commands and other information needed to access the system. On the suspect’s computer, the investigator found a diary detailing the suspect’s actions over 15 years, including the\n",

      "Outside experts can also give you detailed information you need to retrieve digital evidence. For example, a recent murder case involved a husband and wife who owned a Macintosh store. When the wife was discovered dead, apparently murdered, investigators found that she had wanted to leave her husband but didn’t because of her religious beliefs. The police got a search warrant and confiscated the home and office computers. When the detective on the case examined the home system, he found that the hard drive had been compressed and erased. He contacted a Macintosh engineer, who determined the two software programs used to compress the drive. With this knowledge, the detective could retrieve information from the hard drive, including text files indicating that the husband spent $35,000 in\n",

      "Preparing for Digital Investigations\n",
      "Digital investigations can be categorized several ways. For the purposes of this discussion, however, they fall into two categories: public-sector investigations and private-sector investigations (see Figure 1-4).\n",
      "In general, public-sector investigations involve government agencies responsible for criminal investigations and prosecution. Government agencies range from municipal, county, and state or provincial police departments to federal law enforcement agencies. These organizations must observe legal guidelines of their jurisdictions, such as Article 8 in the Charter of Rights of Canada and the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution restricting government search and seizure The legal act of acquiring evidence for an investigation. See also Fourth Amendment. (see Figure 1-5). The law of search and seizure in the United States protects the rights of people, including people suspected of crimes; as a digital forensics examiner, you must follow these laws. The Department of Justice (DOJ) updates\n",
      "a digital forensics examiner, you must follow these laws. The Department of Justice (DOJ) updates information on computer search and seizure regularly.\n",
      "Private-sector investigations focus more on policy violations, such as not adhering to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulations. However, criminal acts, such as corporate espionage, can also occur. So although private-sector investigations often start as civil cases, they can develop into criminal cases; likewise, a criminal case can have implications leading to a civil case. If you follow good forensics procedures, the evidence found in your examinations can make the transition between civil and criminal cases.\n",
      "Understanding Law Enforcement Agency Investigations\n",
      "When conducting public-sector investigations, you must understand laws on computer-related crimes, including standard legal processes, guidelines on search and seizure, and how to build a criminal case. In a criminal case, a suspect is charged with a criminal offense, such as burglary, murder, molestation, or fraud. To determine whether there was a computer crime, an investigator asks questions such as the following: What was the tool used to commit the crime? Was it a simple trespass? Was it a theft or vandalism? Did the perpetrator infringe on someone else’s rights by cyberstalking or e-mail harassment?\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Laws, including procedural rules, vary by jurisdiction. Therefore, this book points out when items accepted in U.S. courts don’t stand up in other courts. Lately, a major issue has been that European Union (EU) privacy laws are more stringent than U.S. privacy laws. Issues related to international companies are still being defined. Over the past few decades, more companies have been consolidating into global entities. As a result, internal company investigations can involve laws of multiple countries. For example, a company has a subsidiary operating in Australia. An employee at that subsidiary is suspected of fraud, and as part of your investigation, you need to seize his cell phone. Under U.S. law, you can if he used it on company property and synchronized it with the company network.\n",
      "U.S. law, you can if he used it on company property and synchronized it with the company network. Under Australian law, you can’t.\n",
      "Computers and networks might be only tools used to commit crimes and are, therefore, analogous to the lockpick a burglar uses to break into a house. For this reason, many states have added specific language to criminal codes to define crimes involving computers. States such as Alabama have wording such as “willfully or without authorization” and specify what dollar amount qualifies as a misdemeanor or a felony. For example, they have expanded the definition of laws for crimes such as theft to include taking data from a computer without the owner’s permission, so computer theft is now on a par with shoplifting or car theft. States have also enacted specific criminal statutes that address computer-related crimes but typically don’t include digital issues in standard trespass, theft,\n",
      "computer-related crimes but typically don’t include digital issues in standard trespass, theft, vandalism, or burglary laws. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was passed in 1986, but specific state laws were generally developed later.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "For information on how each state defines and addresses computer-related crimes, see http://statelaws.findlaw.com/criminal-laws/computer-crimes.html.\n",
      "Many serious crimes involve computers, smartphones, and other digital devices. The most notorious are those involving sexual exploitation of minors. Digital images are stored on hard disks, flash drives, removable hard drives, and the cloud and are circulated on the Internet. Other computer crimes concern missing children and adults because information about missing people is often found on computers. Drug dealers, car theft rings, and other criminals often keep information about transactions on their computers, laptops, smartphones, and other devices.\n",
      "Following Legal Processes\n",
      "When conducting a computer investigation for potential criminal violations of the law, the legal processes you follow depend on local custom, legislative standards, and rules of evidence. In general, however, a criminal case follows three stages: the complaint, the investigation, and the prosecution. Someone files a complaint, and then a specialist investigates the complaint and, with the help of a prosecutor, collects evidence and builds a case. If the evidence is sufficient, the case might proceed to trial.\n",
      "A criminal investigation generally begins when someone finds evidence of or witnesses an illegal act. The witness or victim makes an allegation A charge made against someone or something before proof has been found. to the police, an accusation of fact that a crime has been committed.\n",
      "A police officer interviews the complainant and writes a report about the crime. The law enforcement agency processes the report, and management decides to start an investigation or log the information into a police blotter, which provides a record of information about crimes that have been committed previously. Criminals often repeat actions in their illegal activities, and these patterns can be discovered by examining police blotters. This historical knowledge is useful when conducting investigations, especially in high-technology crimes. Blotters now are generally electronic files, often structured as databases, so they can be searched more easily than the old paper blotters.\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "To see an example of a police blotter, go to http://spdblotter.seattle.gov.\n",
      "Not every police officer is a computer expert. Some are computer novices; others might be trained to recognize what they can retrieve from a computer disk. To differentiate the training and experience officers have, ISO standard 27037 (www.iso.org/standard/44381.html) defines two categories. A Digital Evidence First Responder (DEFR) A professional who secures digital evidence at the scene and ensures its viability while transporting it to the lab. has the skill and training to arrive on an incident scene, assess the situation, and take precautions to acquire and preserve evidence. A Digital Evidence Specialist (DES) An expert who analyzes digital evidence and determines whether additional specialists are needed. has the skill to analyze the data and determine when another specialist should\n",
      "are needed. has the skill to analyze the data and determine when another specialist should be called in to assist with the analysis.\n",
      "If you’re an examiner assigned to a case, recognize the level of expertise of police officers and others involved in the case. You should have DES training to conduct the examination of systems and manage the digital forensics aspects of the case. You start by assessing the scope of the case, which includes the device’s OS, hardware, and peripheral devices. You then determine whether resources are available to process all the evidence. Determine whether you have the right tools to collect and analyze evidence and whether you need to call on other specialists to assist in collecting and processing evidence. After you have gathered the resources you need, your role is to delegate, collect, and process the information related to the complaint. After you build a case, the information is turned\n",
      "process the information related to the complaint. After you build a case, the information is turned over to the prosecutor. As an investigator, you must then present the collected evidence with a report to the government’s attorney. Depending on the community and the nature of the crime, the prosecutor’s title varies by jurisdiction.\n",
      "In a criminal or public-sector case, if the police officer or investigator has sufficient cause to support a search warrant, the prosecuting attorney might direct him or her to submit an affidavit A notarized document, given under penalty of perjury, that investigators create to detail their findings. This document is often used to justify issuing a warrant or to deal with abuse in a corporation. Also called a “declaration” when the document isn’t notarized. (also called a “declaration”). This sworn statement of support of facts about or evidence of a crime is submitted to a judge with the request for a search warrant before seizing evidence. Figure 1-6 shows a typical affidavit. It’s your responsibility to write the affidavit, which must include exhibits Evidence used in court to prove a\n",

You must then have the affidavit notarized under sworn oath to verify that the information in the affidavit is true. (You learn more about affidavits and declarations in Chapter 14.)\n",
      "In general, after a judge approves and signs a search warrant, it’s ready to be executed, meaning a DEFR can collect evidence as defined by the warrant. After you collect the evidence, you process and analyze it to determine whether a crime actually occurred. The evidence can then be presented in court in a hearing or trial. A judge or an administrative law judge then renders a judgment, or a jury hands down a verdict The decision returned by a jury. (after which a judge can enter a judgment).\n",
      "Understanding Private-Sector Investigations\n",
      "Private-sector investigations involve private companies and lawyers who address company policy violations and litigation disputes, such as wrongful termination. When conducting an investigation for a private company, remember that business must continue with minimal interruption from your investigation. Because businesses usually focus on continuing their usual operations and making profits, many in a private-sector environment consider your investigation and apprehension of a suspect secondary to stopping the violation and minimizing damage or loss to the business. Businesses also strive to minimize or eliminate litigation, which is an expensive way to address criminal or civil issues. Private-sector computer crimes can involve e-mail harassment; gender and age discrimination;\n",
      "Private-sector computer crimes can involve e-mail harassment; gender and age discrimination; white-collar crimes Financial crimes, including falsification of financial information, fraud, identify theft, intellectual property theft and piracy, embezzlement, and money laundering. (defined by the FBI, www.fbi.gov/investigate/white-collar-crime), such as falsification of data, embezzlement, and sabotage; and industrial espionage Theft of company sensitive or proprietary company information often to sell to a competitor. , which involves selling sensitive or confidential company information to a competitor. Anyone with access to a computer can commit these crimes.\n",
      "Establishing Company Policies\n",
      "One way that businesses can reduce the risk of litigation is to publish and maintain policies that employees find easy to read and follow. In addition, these policies can make internal investigations go more smoothly. The most important policies are those defining rules for using the company’s computers and networks; this type of policy is commonly known as an “acceptable use policy.” Organizations should have all employees sign this acceptable use agreement. Published company policies also provide a line of authority The order in which people or positions are notified of a problem; these people or positions have the legal right to initiate an investigation, take possession of evidence, and have access to evidence. for conducting internal investigations; it states who has the legal right\n",
      "have access to evidence. for conducting internal investigations; it states who has the legal right to initiate an investigation, who can take possession of evidence, and who can have access to evidence.\n",
      "Well-defined policies give computer investigators and forensics examiners the authority to conduct an investigation. Policies also demonstrate that an organization intends to be fair-minded and objective about how it treats employees and state that the organization will follow due process for all investigations. (“Due process” refers to fairness under the law and is meant to protect all.) Without defined policies, a business risks exposing itself to litigation from current or former employees. The person or committee in charge of maintaining company policies must also stay current with applicable laws, which can vary depending on the city, state, and country. In addition, training and updates on standards and policies should be scheduled regularly to keep employees informed of what should\n",
      "on standards and policies should be scheduled regularly to keep employees informed of what should and shouldn’t be done on the organization’s network.\n",
      "Displaying Warning Banners\n",
      "Another way a private or public organization can avoid litigation is to display a warning banner on computer screens. A warning banner Text displayed on computer screens when people log on to a company computer; this text states ownership of the computer and specifies appropriate use of the machine or Internet access. usually appears when a computer starts or connects to the company intranet, network, or virtual private network (VPN) and informs end users that the organization reserves the right to inspect computer systems and network traffic at will. (An end user is a person using a computer to perform routine tasks other than system administration.) If this right isn’t stated explicitly, employees might have an assumed right of privacy when using a company’s computer systems and network\n",
      "might have an assumed right of privacy when using a company’s computer systems and network accesses. Figure 1-7 shows a sample warning banner.\n",
      "A warning banner asserts the right to conduct an investigation and notifies the user. By displaying a strong, well-worded warning banner, an organization owning computer equipment doesn’t need a search warrant or court order as required under Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure rules to seize the equipment. In a company with a well-defined policy, this right to inspect or search at will applies to both criminal activity and company policy violations. Keep in mind, however, that your country’s laws might differ. For example, in some countries, even though the company has the right to seize computers at any time, if employees are suspected of a criminal act, they must be informed at that time.\n",
      "The following list recommends phrases to include in warning banners. Before using these warnings, consult with the organization’s legal department for other required legal notices for your work area or department. Depending on the type of organization, the following text can be used in internal warning banners:\n",
      "Access to this system and network is restricted.\n",
      "Use of this system and network is for official business only.\n",
      "Systems and networks are subject to monitoring at any time by the owner.\n",
      "Using this system implies consent to monitoring by the owner.\n",
      "Unauthorized or illegal users of this system or network will be subject to discipline or prosecution.\n",
      "Users of this system agree that they have no expectation of privacy relating to all activity performed on this system.\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "The DOJ document at www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/docs/ssmanual2009.pdf has several examples of warning banners.\n",
      "An organization such as a community college might simply state that systems and networks are subject to observation and monitoring at any time because members of the local community who aren’t staff or students might use the facilities. A for-profit organization, on the other hand, could have proprietary information on its network and use all the phrases suggested in the preceding list. Guests, such as employees of business partners, might be allowed to use the system. The text that’s displayed when a guest attempts to log on can include warnings similar to the following:\n",
      "This system is the property of Company X.\n",
      "This system is for authorized use only; unauthorized access is a violation of law and violators will be prosecuted.\n",
      "All activity, software, network traffic, and communications are subject to monitoring.\n",
      "As a private-sector digital investigator, make sure a company displays a clearly worded warning banner. Without a banner, your authority to inspect might conflict with the user’s expectation of privacy, and a court might have to determine the issue of authority to inspect. State laws vary on the expectation of privacy, but all states accept the concept of a waiver of the expectation of privacy. Additionally, the EU and its member nations impose substantial penalties for personal information that crosses national boundaries without the person’s consent. For example, if your company is conducting an investigation at its subsidiary in the EU, you might not be able to acquire a network drive without notifying certain parties or making sure consent documents are in place.\n",
      "Some might argue that written policies are all that are necessary. However, in the actual prosecution of cases, warning banners have been critical in determining that a user didn’t have an expectation of privacy for information stored on the system. A warning banner has the additional advantage of being easier to present in trial as an exhibit than a policy manual. Government agencies, such as the Department of Energy, NASA, Lawrence Livermore Labs, and even public libraries, now require warning banners on all computer terminals on their systems. Many corporations also require warning banners as part of the logon/startup process.\n",
      "Designating an Authorized Requester\n",
      "As mentioned, investigations must establish a line of authority. In addition to using warning banners that state a company’s rights of computer ownership, businesses are advised to specify an authorized requester In a private-sector environment, the person who has the right to request an investigation, such as the chief security officer or chief intelligence officer. who has the power to initiate investigations. Executive management should define a policy to avoid conflicts from competing interests in organizations. In large organizations, competition for funding or management support can become so fierce that people might create false allegations of misconduct to prevent competing departments from delivering a proposal for the same source of funds.\n",
      "To avoid inappropriate investigations, executive management must also define and limit who’s authorized to request a computer investigation and forensics analysis. Generally, the fewer groups with authority to request a computer investigation, the better. Examples of groups with this authority in a private-sector environment include the following:\n",
      "Corporate security investigations\n",
      "Corporate ethics office\n",
      "Corporate equal employment opportunity office\n",
      "Internal auditing\n",
      "The general counsel or legal department\n",
      "All other groups should coordinate their requests through the corporate security investigations group. This policy separates the investigative process from the process of employee discipline.\n",
      "Conducting Security Investigations\n",
      "Conducting a digital investigation in the private sector is not much different from conducting one in the public sector. During public investigations, you search for evidence to support criminal allegations. During private investigations, you search for evidence to support allegations of violations of a company’s rules or an attack on its assets. Three types of situations are common in private-sector environments:\n",
      "Abuse or misuse of digital assets\n",
      "E-mail abuse\n",
      "Internet abuse\n",
      "Most digital investigations in the private sector involve misuse of digital assets. Typically, this misuse is referred to as “company rules violation.” Digital abuse complaints often center on e-mail and Internet misuse by employees but could involve other digital resources, such as using company software to produce a product for personal profit. The scope of an e-mail investigation ranges from excessive use of a company’s e-mail system for personal use to making threats or harassing others via e-mail. Some common e-mail abuses involve transmitting offensive messages. These types of messages can create a hostile work environment An environment in which employees can’t perform their assigned duties because of the actions of others. In the workplace, these actions include sending threatening\n",
      "because of the actions of others. In the workplace, these actions include sending threatening or demeaning e-mail or a co-worker viewing pornographic or hate sites. that can result in an employee’s civil lawsuit against a company that does nothing to prevent or respond to it (in other words, implicitly condones the e-mail abuse).\n",
      "Digital investigators also examine Internet abuse. Employees’ abuse of Internet privileges ranges from excessive use, such as spending all day Web surfing, to viewing pornographic pictures on the Internet while at work. An extreme instance of Internet abuse is viewing contraband (illegal) pornographic images, such as child pornography. Viewing contraband images is a criminal act in most jurisdictions, and digital investigators must handle this situation with the highest level of professionalism and notify law enforcement. By enforcing policies consistently, a company minimizes its liability exposure. The role of a digital forensics examiner is to give management personnel complete and accurate information so that they can verify and correct abuse problems in an organization. (In later\n",
      "information so that they can verify and correct abuse problems in an organization. (In later chapters, you learn the procedures for conducting these types of investigations.)\n",
      "Actions that seem related to internal abuse could also have criminal or civil liability. Because any civil investigation can become a criminal investigation, you must treat all evidence you collect with the highest level of security and accountability. Later in this book, you learn the Federal Rules of Evidence (processes to ensure the chain of custody) and how to apply them to digital investigations.\n",
      "Similarly, your private-sector investigation might seem to involve a civil, noncriminal matter, but as you progress through your analysis, you might identify a criminal matter, too. Because of this possibility, always remember that your work can come under the scrutiny of the civil or criminal legal system. The Federal Rules of Evidence are the same for civil and criminal matters. By applying the rules to all investigations uniformly, you eliminate any concerns about the admissibility of the evidence you develop. These standards are emphasized throughout this book.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "The silver-platter doctrine used to allow a civilian or private-sector investigative agent to deliver evidence obtained in a manner that violated the Fourth Amendment to a law enforcement agency. However, this doctrine was ruled unconstitutional in 1960 (see Elkins v. United States, 1960).\n",
      "Remember that a police officer is a law enforcement agent. A private-sector investigator’s job is to minimize risk to the company. After you turn over evidence to law enforcement and begin working under their direction, you become an agent of law enforcement, subject to the same restrictions on search and seizure as a law enforcement agent. A law enforcement agent can’t ask you, as a private citizen, to obtain evidence that requires a warrant. The rules controlling the use of evidence collected by private citizens vary by jurisdiction, so check the law if you’re investigating a case outside the United States.\n",
      "Litigation is costly, so after you have assembled evidence, offending employees are usually disciplined. However, when you discover that a criminal act involving a third-party victim has been committed, you might have a legal and moral obligation to turn the information over to law enforcement. In the next section, you learn about situations in which criminal evidence must be separated from any company proprietary information.\n",
      "Distinguishing Personal and Company Property\n",
      "Many company policies distinguish between personal and company computer property; however, making this distinction can be difficult with cell phones, smartphones, personal notebooks, and tablet computers. For example, an employee brings her personal tablet to work and connects it to the company’s wireless network. As the employee synchronizes information on the tablet with information in the company network, she copies some data in the tablet to the company network. During the synchronization, data on the company computer or network might be placed on the tablet, too. In this case, at least one question is “Does the information on the tablet belong to the company or the employee?”\n",
      "Now suppose the company gave the employee the tablet as a holiday bonus. Can the company claim rights to this device? Similar issues come up when an employee brings in a smartphone and connects it to the company network. What rules apply? Because digital devices are part of daily life, you’ll encounter these issues often. These questions are still being debated, however, and companies are establishing their own policies to handle them. In today’s bring your own device (BYOD) environment, more companies are forced to address the issue of personal devices accessing the company network. Some companies simply state that if you connect a personal device to the business network, it falls under the same rules as company property.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "BYOD is a major challenge in company security, digital investigations, and compliance with regulations, including company policies.\n",
      "Maintaining Professional Conduct\n",
      "Your professional conduct as a digital investigator is critical because it determines your credibility. Professional conduct Behavior expected of an employee in the workplace or other professional setting. , discussed in more detail in Chapters 15 and 16, includes ethics, morals, and standards of behavior. As a professional, you must exhibit the highest level of professional behavior at all times. To do so, you must maintain objectivity and confidentiality during an investigation, expand your technical knowledge constantly, and conduct yourself with integrity. Maintaining objectivity means you form opinions based on your education, training, experience, and the evidence in your cases. Avoid making conclusions about your findings until you have exhausted all reasonable leads and considered\n",
      "making conclusions about your findings until you have exhausted all reasonable leads and considered the available facts. Your ultimate responsibility is to find relevant digital evidence. You must avoid prejudice or bias to maintain the integrity of your fact-finding in all investigations. For example, if you’re employed by an attorney, don’t allow the attorney’s agenda to dictate the outcome of your investigation. Your reputation depends on maintaining your objectivity.\n",
      "You must also maintain an investigation’s credibility by maintaining confidentiality. Discuss the case only with people who need to know about it, such as other investigators involved in the case or someone in the line of authority. If you need advice from other professionals, discuss only the general terms and facts about the case without mentioning specifics. All investigations you conduct must be kept confidential, until you’re designated as a witness or required by the attorney or court to release a report.\n",
      "In the private-sector environment, confidentiality is critical, especially when dealing with employees who have been terminated. The agreement between the company and the employee might have been to represent the termination as a layoff or resignation in exchange for no bad references. If you give case details and the employee’s name to others, your company could be liable for breach of contract.\n",
      "In some instances, a civil case might become a criminal case, and it could be years before the case finally goes to trial or is settled. If an investigator talks about evidence with unauthorized people, the case could be damaged. When working for an attorney on an investigation, the attorney-work-product rule applies to all communications. This means you can discuss the case only with the attorney or other members of the team working with the attorney. All communication about the case to other people requires the attorney’s approval.\n",
      "In addition to maintaining objectivity and confidentiality, you can enhance your professional conduct by continuing your training. The field of digital investigations and forensics is changing constantly. You should stay current with the latest technical changes in computer hardware and software, networking, and forensic tools. You should also learn about the latest investigation techniques you can use in your cases. To continue your professional training, you should attend workshops, conferences, and vendor courses. You might also need to continue or enhance your formal education, such as pursuing certifications. You improve your professional standing if you have at least an undergraduate degree in computing or a related field. If you don’t have an advanced degree, consider graduate-level\n",
      "in computing or a related field. If you don’t have an advanced degree, consider graduate-level studies in a complementary area of study, such as business law or e-commerce. Several colleges and universities now offer associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees and certificate programs in digital forensics. Many companies are willing to assist with employee education expenses because it’s to their advantage that employees remain current in their knowledge.\n",
      "In addition to education and training, membership in professional organizations adds to your credentials. These organizations often sponsor training and publications on the latest technical improvements and trends in digital forensic examinations. Also, keep up to date with the most current publications on digital forensics examination tools and techniques.\n",
      "As a digital investigator and forensics professional, you’re expected to maintain honesty and integrity. You must conduct yourself with the highest levels of integrity in all aspects of your life. Any indiscreet actions can embarrass you and give opposing attorneys opportunities to discredit you during your testimony in court or in depositions.\n",
      "Preparing a Digital Forensics Investigation\n",
      "Your role as a digital forensics professional is to gather data from a suspect’s computer and determine whether there’s evidence that a crime was committed or company policies or industry regulations have been violated. If the evidence suggests that a crime or policy violation has been committed, you begin to prepare a case, which is a collection of evidence you can offer in court or at a private-sector inquiry. This process involves investigating the suspect’s computer and then preserving the evidence on a different computer. Before you begin investigating, however, you must follow an accepted procedure to prepare a case. By approaching each case methodically, you can evaluate the evidence thoroughly and document the chain of custody The route evidence takes from the time the investigator\n",
      "and document the chain of custody The route evidence takes from the time the investigator obtains it until the case is closed or goes to court. , which is the route evidence takes from the time you find it until the case is closed or goes to court.\n",
      "The following sections present two sample cases—one involving a computer crime and another involving a company policy violation. Each example describes the typical steps of a forensics investigation, including gathering evidence, preparing a case, and preserving the evidence.\n",
      "An Overview of a Computer Crime\n",
      "Law enforcement officers often find computers, smartphones, and other devices as they’re investigating crimes, gathering other evidence, or making arrests. These devices can contain information that helps law enforcement officers determine the chain of events leading to a crime or information providing evidence that’s more likely to lead to a conviction. As an example of a case in which computers were involved in a crime, the police raided a suspected drug dealer’s home and found a desktop computer, several USB drives (also called “flash drives” or “thumb drives”), a tablet computer, and a cell phone in a bedroom (see Figure 1-8). The computer was “bagged and tagged,” meaning it was placed in evidence bags along with the storage media and then labeled with tags as part of the search and\n",
      "in evidence bags along with the storage media and then labeled with tags as part of the search and seizure.\n",
      "The lead detective on the case wants you to examine the computer and cell phone to find and organize data that could be evidence of a crime, such as files containing names of the drug dealer’s contacts, text messages, and photos. The acquisitions officer gives you documentation of items the investigating officers collected with the computer, including a list of other storage media, such as removable disks and flash drives. The acquisitions officer also notes that the computer is a Windows 8 system, and the machine was running when it was discovered. Before shutting down the computer, the acquisitions officer photographs all open windows on the Windows desktop, including one showing File Explorer, and gives you the photos. (Before shutting down the computer, a live acquisition should be\n",

      "As a digital forensics investigator, you’re grateful the officers followed proper procedure when acquiring the evidence. With digital evidence, it’s important to realize how easily key data, such as the last access date, can be altered by an overeager investigator who’s first on the scene. The U.S. DOJ has a document you can download that reviews the correct acquisition of electronic evidence, “Prosecuting Computer Crimes” (www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ssmanual2009.pdf, 2009).

      "After your preliminary assessment, you identify the potential challenges in this case. Later, you perform the steps needed to investigate the case, including how to address risks and obstacles. Then you can begin the actual investigation and data retrieval.\n",
      "An Overview of a Company Policy Violation\n",
      "Companies often establish policies for employee use of computers. Employees surfing the Internet, sending personal e-mail, or using company computers for personal tasks during work hours can waste company time. Because lost time can cost companies millions of dollars, digital forensics specialists are often used to investigate policy violations. The following example describes a company policy violation.\n",
      "Manager Steve Billings has been receiving complaints from customers about the job performance of one of his sales representatives, George Montgomery. George has worked as a representative for several years. He’s been absent from work for two days but hasn’t called in sick or told anyone why he wouldn’t be at work. Another employee, Martha, is also missing and hasn’t informed anyone of the reason for her absence. Steve asks the IT Department to confiscate George’s hard drive and all storage media in his work area. He wants to know whether any information on George’s computer and storage media might offer a clue to his whereabouts and job performance concerns. To help determine George’s and Martha’s whereabouts, you must take a systematic approach, described in the following section, to\n",
      "Martha’s whereabouts, you must take a systematic approach, described in the following section, to examining and analyzing the data found on George’s desk.\n",
      "Taking a Systematic Approach\n",
      "When preparing a case, you can apply standard systems analysis steps, explained in the following list, to problem solving. Later in this chapter, you apply these steps to cases.\n",
      "Make an initial assessment about the type of case you’re investigating—To assess the type of case you’re handling, talk to others involved in the case and ask questions about the incident. Have law enforcement or company security officers already seized the computer, disks, peripherals, and other components? Do you need to visit an office or another location? Was the computer used to commit a crime, or does it contain evidence about another crime?\n",
      "Determine a preliminary design or approach to the case—Outline the general steps you need to follow to investigate the case. If the suspect is an employee and you need to acquire his or her system, determine whether you can seize the computer during work hours or have to wait until evening or weekend hours. If you’re preparing a criminal case, determine what information law enforcement officers have already gathered.\n",
      "Create a detailed checklist—Refine the general outline by creating a detailed checklist of steps and an estimated amount of time for each step. This outline helps you stay on track during the investigation.\n",
      "Determine the resources you need—Based on the OS of the computer you’re investigating, list the software you plan to use for the investigation, noting any other software, tools, or expert assistance you might need.\n",
      "Obtain and copy an evidence drive—In some cases, you might be seizing multiple computers along with CDs, DVDs, USB drives, mobile devices, and other removable media. (For the examples in this chapter, you’re using only USB drives.) Make a forensic copy of the disk.\n",
      "Identify the risks—List the problems you normally expect in the type of case you’re handling. This list is known as a standard risk assessment. For example, if the suspect seems knowledgeable about computers, he or she might have set up a logon scheme that shuts down the computer or overwrites data on the hard disk when someone tries to change the logon password.\n",
      "Mitigate or minimize the risks—Identify how you can minimize the risks. For example, if you’re working with a computer on which the suspect has likely password-protected the hard drive, you can make multiple copies of the original media before starting. Then if you destroy a copy during the process of retrieving information from the disk, you have additional copies.\n",
      "Test the design—Review the decisions you’ve made and the steps you’ve completed. If you have already copied the original media, a standard part of testing the design involves comparing hash values (discussed in Chapters 3 and 4) to ensure that you copied the original media correctly.\n",
      "Analyze and recover the digital evidence—Using the software tools and other resources you’ve gathered, and making sure you’ve addressed any risks and obstacles, examine the disk to find digital evidence.\n",
      "Investigate the data you recover—View the information recovered from the disk, including existing files, deleted files, e-mail, and Web history, and organize the files to help find information relevant to the case.\n",
      "Complete the case report—Write a complete report detailing what you did and what you found.\n",
      "Critique the case—Self-evaluation and peer review are essential parts of professional growth. After you complete a case, review it to identify successful decisions and actions and determine how you could have improved your performance.\n",
      "The amount of time and effort you put into each step varies, depending on the nature of the investigation. For example, in most cases, you need to create a simple investigation plan so that you don’t overlook any steps. However, if a case involves many computers with complex issues to identify and examine, a detailed plan with periodic review and updates is essential. A systematic approach helps you discover the information you need for your case, and you should gather as much information as possible.\n",
      "For all digital investigations, you must be prepared for the unexpected, so you should always have a contingency plan for the investigation. A contingency plan can consist of anything to help you complete the investigation, from alternative software and hardware tools to other methods of approaching the investigation.\n",
      "Assessing the Case\n",
      "As mentioned, identifying case requirements involves determining the type of case you’re investigating. Doing so means you should outline the case details systematically, including the nature of the case, the type of evidence available, and the location of evidence.\n",
      "In the company-policy violation case, you have been asked to investigate George Montgomery. Steve Billings had the IT Department confiscate George’s storage media that might contain information about his whereabouts. After talking to George’s co-workers, Steve learned that George has been conducting a personal business on the side using company computers. Therefore, the focus of the case has shifted to include possible employee abuse of company resources. You can begin assessing this case as follows:\n",
      "Situation—Employee abuse of resources.\n",
      "Nature of the case—Side business conducted on the company computer.\n",
      "Specifics of the case—The employee is reportedly conducting a side business on his company computer that involves registering domain names for clients and setting up their Web sites at local ISPs. Co-workers have complained that he’s been spending too much time on his own business and not performing his assigned work duties. Company policy states that all company-owned digital assets are subject to inspection by company management at any time. Employees have no expectation of privacy when operating company computer systems.\n",
      "Type of evidence—Small-capacity USB drive connected to a company computer.\n",
      "Known disk format—NTFS.\n",
      "Location of evidence—One USB drive recovered from the employee’s assigned computer.\n",
      "Based on these details, you can determine the case requirements. You now know that the nature of the case involves employee abuse of company resources, and you’re looking for evidence that an employee was conducting a side business using his employer’s computers. On the USB drive retrieved from George’s computer, you’re looking for any information related to Web sites, ISPs, or domain names. You know that the USB drive uses the NTFS file system. To duplicate the USB drive and find deleted and hidden files, you need a reliable digital forensics tool. Because the USB drive has already been retrieved, you don’t need to seize the drive yourself. You call this case Montgomery_72018 (because the case opened on July 20, 2018) and determine that your task is to gather data from the storage media\n",
      "case opened on July 20, 2018) and determine that your task is to gather data from the storage media seized to confirm or deny the allegation that George is conducting a side business on company time and computers. Remember that he’s suspected only of resource abuse, and the evidence you obtain might be exculpatory—meaning it could prove his innocence. You must always maintain an unbiased perspective and be objective in your fact-findings. If you are systematic and thorough, you’re more likely to produce consistently reliable results.\n",
      "Planning Your Investigation\n",
      "Now that you have identified the requirements of the Montgomery_72018 case, you can plan your investigation. You have already determined the kind of evidence you need; now you can identify the specific steps to gather the evidence, establish a chain of custody, and perform the forensic analysis. These steps become the basic plan for your investigation and indicate what you should do and when. To investigate the Montgomery_72018 case, you should perform the following general steps. Most of these steps are explained in more detail in the following sections.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Acquire the USB drive from the IT Department, which bagged and tagged the evidence.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Complete an evidence form and establish a chain of custody.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Transport the evidence to your digital forensics lab.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Place the evidence in an approved secure container A fireproof container locked by a key or combination. .\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Prepare your forensic workstation.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Retrieve the evidence from the secure container.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Make a forensic copy of the evidence drive (in this case, the USB drive).\n",
      "8.\n",
      "Return the evidence drive to the secure container.\n",
      "9.\n",
      "Process the copied evidence drive with your digital forensics tools.\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "The approved secure container you need in Step 4 should be a locked, fireproof locker or cabinet that has limited access. Limited access means that only you and other authorized personnel can open the secure container.\n",
      "The first rule for all investigations is to preserve the evidence, which means it shouldn’t be tampered with or contaminated. Because the IT Department staff confiscated the storage media, you need to go to them for the evidence. The IT Department manager confirms that the storage media has been locked in a secure cabinet since it was retrieved from George’s desk. Keep in mind that even though this case is a company policy matter, many cases are thrown out because the chain of custody can’t be proved or has been broken. When this happens, there’s the possibility that the evidence has been compromised.\n",
      "To document the evidence, you record details about the media, including who recovered the evidence and when and who possessed it and when. Use an evidence custody form A printed form indicating who has signed out and been in physical possession of evidence. , also called a chain-of-evidence form, which helps you document what has and has not been done with the original evidence and forensic copies of the evidence. Depending on whether you’re working in law enforcement or private security, you can create an evidence custody form to fit your environment. This form should be easy to read and use. It can contain information for one or several pieces of evidence. Consider creating a single-evidence form A form that dedicates a page for each item retrieved for a case. It allows investigators to\n",
      "form A form that dedicates a page for each item retrieved for a case. It allows investigators to add more detail about exactly what was done to the evidence each time it was taken from the storage locker. See also evidence custody form. (which lists each piece of evidence on a separate page) and a multi-evidence form An evidence custody form used to list all items associated with a case. See also evidence custody form. (see Figure 1-9), depending on the administrative needs of your investigation.\n",
      "If necessary, document how to use your evidence custody form. Clear instructions help users remain consistent when completing the form and ensure that everyone uses the same definitions for collected items. Standardization helps maintain consistent quality for all investigations and prevent confusion and mistakes about the evidence you collect. An evidence custody form usually contains the following information:\n",
      "Case number—The number your organization assigns when an investigation is initiated.\n",
      "Investigating organization—The name of your organization. In large corporations with global facilities, several organizations might be conducting investigations in different geographic areas.\n",
      "Investigator—The name of the investigator assigned to the case. If many investigators are assigned, specify the lead investigator’s name.\n",
      "Nature of case—A short description of the case. For example, in the private-sector environment, it might be “data recovery for corporate litigation” or “employee policy violation case.”\n",
      "Location evidence was obtained—The exact location where the evidence was collected. If you’re using multi-evidence forms, a new form should be created for each location.\n",
      "Description of evidence—A list of the evidence items, such as “hard drive, 250 GB” or “one USB drive, 8 GB.” On a multi-evidence form, write a description for each item of evidence you acquire and possibly include photos.\n",
      "Vendor name—The name of the manufacturer of the computer component. List a 250 GB hard drive, for example, as a “Maxtor 250 GB hard drive,” or describe a USB drive as a “SanDisk 8 GB USB drive.” In later chapters, you see how differences among manufacturers can affect data recovery.\n",
      "Model number or serial number—List the model number or serial number (if available) of the computer component. Many computer components, including hard drives, memory chips, and expansion slot cards, have model numbers but not serial numbers.\n",
      "Evidence recovered by—The name of the investigator who recovered the evidence. The chain of custody for evidence starts with this information. If you insert your name, for example, you’re declaring that you have taken control of the evidence. It’s now your responsibility to ensure that nothing damages the evidence and no one tampers with it. The person placing his or her name on this line is responsible for preserving, transporting, and securing the evidence.\n",
      "Date and time—The date and time the evidence was taken into custody. This information establishes exactly when the chain of custody starts.\n",
      "Evidence placed in locker—Specifies which approved secure container is used to store evidence and when the evidence was placed in the container.\n",
      "Item #/Evidence processed by/Disposition of evidence/Date/Time—When you or another authorized investigator retrieves evidence from the evidence locker for processing and analysis, list the item number and your name, and then describe what was done to the evidence.\n",
      "Page—The forms used to catalog all evidence for each location should have page numbers. List the page number, and indicate the total number of pages for this group of evidence. For example, if you collected 15 pieces of evidence at one location and your form has only 10 lines, you need to fill out two multi-evidence forms. The first form is noted as “Page 1 of 2,” and the second page is noted as “Page 2 of 2.”\n",
      "Figure 1-10 shows a single-evidence form, which lists only one piece of evidence per page. This form gives you more flexibility in tracking separate pieces of evidence for your chain-of-custody log. It also has more space for descriptions, which is helpful when finalizing the investigation and creating a case report. With this form, you can accurately account for what was done to the evidence and what was found. Use evidence forms as a reference for all actions taken during your investigative analysis.\n",
      "You can use both multi-evidence and single-evidence forms in your investigation. By using two forms, you can keep the single-evidence form with the evidence and the multi-evidence form in your report file. Two forms also provide redundancy that can be used as a quality control for evidence.\n",
      "Securing Your Evidence\n",
      "Digital investigations demand that you adjust your procedures to suit the case. For example, if the evidence for a case includes an entire computer system and associated storage media, such as flash drives and large external hard drives, you must be flexible when you account for all these items. Some evidence is small enough to fit into an evidence bag. Other items, such as CPU cabinets, monitors, keyboards, and printers, are too large.\n",
      "To secure and catalog the evidence contained in large computer components, you can use large evidence bags Nonstatic bags used to transport computer components and other digital devices. , tape, tags, labels, and other products available from police supply vendors or office supply stores. When gathering products to secure your computer evidence, make sure they are safe and effective to use on computer components. Be cautious when handling any computer component to avoid damaging the component or coming into contact with static electricity, which can destroy digital data. For this reason, make sure you use antistatic bags when collecting computer evidence. Consider using an antistatic pad with an attached wrist strap, too. Both help prevent damage to computer evidence.\n",
      "Note\n",
      "This section focuses on securing computers and related hardware. Devices such as smartphones and cell phones are covered later in Chapter 12.\n",
      "Be sure to place computer evidence in a well-padded container. Padding prevents damage to the evidence as you transport it to your secure evidence locker, evidence room, or computer lab. Save discarded hard drive boxes, antistatic bags, and packing material for computer hardware when you or others acquire computer devices.\n",
      "Because you might not have everything needed to secure your evidence, you have to improvise. Securing evidence often requires building secure containers. If the computer component is large and contained in its own casing, you can use evidence tape to seal all openings on the cabinet. Placing evidence tape over drive bays, insertion slots for power supply cords and USB cables, and any other openings ensures the security of evidence. As a standard practice, you should write your initials on the tape before applying it to the evidence. This practice makes it possible to prove later in court that the evidence hasn’t been tampered with because the casing couldn’t have been opened nor could power have been supplied to the closed casing with this tape in place. If the tape had been replaced, your\n",
      "been supplied to the closed casing with this tape in place. If the tape had been replaced, your initials wouldn’t be present, which would indicate tampering. If you transport a computer, place new disks in disk drives to reduce possible drive damage while you’re moving it.\n",
      "Computer components require specific temperature and humidity ranges. If it’s too cold, hot, or wet, computer components and magnetic media can be damaged. Even heated car seats can damage digital media, and placing a computer on top of a two-way car radio in the trunk can damage magnetic media. When collecting computer evidence, make sure you have a safe environment for transporting and storing it until a secure evidence container is available.\n",
      "Procedures for Private-Sector High-Tech Investigations\n",
      "As an investigator, you need to develop formal procedures and informal checklists to cover all issues important to high-tech investigations. These procedures are necessary to ensure that correct techniques are used in an investigation. Use informal checklists to be certain that all evidence is collected and processed correctly. This section lists some sample procedures that digital investigators commonly use in private-sector high-tech investigations.\n",
      "Employee Termination Cases\n",
      "Most investigative work for termination cases involves employee abuse of company resources. Incidents that create a hostile work environment, such as viewing pornography in the workplace and sending inappropriate e-mails, are the predominant types of cases investigated. The following sections describe key points for conducting an investigation that might lead to an employee’s termination. Consulting with your organization’s general counsel and Human Resources Department for specific directions on how to handle these investigations is recommended. Your organization must have appropriate policies in place, as described previously in this chapter.\n",
      "Internet Abuse Investigations\n",
      "The information in this section applies to an organization’s internal private network, not a public ISP. Consult with your organization’s general counsel after reviewing this list, and make changes according to their directions to build your own procedures. To conduct an investigation involving Internet abuse, you need the following:\n",
      "The organization’s Internet proxy server logs\n",
      "Suspect computer’s IP address obtained from your organization’s network administrator\n",
      "Suspect computer’s disk drive\n",
      "Your preferred digital forensics analysis tool\n",
      "The following steps outline the recommended processing of an Internet abuse case:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Use the standard forensic analysis techniques and procedures described in this book for the disk drive examination.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Search for and extract all Web page URLs and other associated information.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Contact the network firewall administrator and request a proxy server log, if it’s available, of the suspect computer’s network device name or IP address for the dates of interest. Consult with your organization’s network administrator to confirm that these logs are maintained and how long the time to live (TTL) is set for the network’s IP address assignments using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Compare the data recovered from forensics analysis with the network server log data to confirm that they match.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "If the URL data matches the network server log and the forensic disk examination, continue analyzing the suspect computer’s drive data, and collect any relevant photos or Web pages that support the allegation. If there are no matches between the network server logs, and the forensic examination shows no contributing evidence, report that the allegation is unsubstantiated.\n",
      "Before investigating an Internet abuse case, research your state or country’s privacy laws. Many countries have unique privacy laws that restrict the use of computer log data, such as network server logs or disk drive cache files, for any type of investigation. Some state or federal laws might supersede your organization’s employee policies. Always consult with your organization’s attorney. For companies with international business operations, jurisdiction is a problem; what’s legal in the United States, such as examining and investigating a network server log, might not be legal in Germany, for example.\n",
      "For investigations in which the network server log doesn’t match the forensics analysis that found inappropriate data, continue the examination of the suspect computer’s disk drive. Determine when inappropriate data was downloaded to the computer and whether it was through an organization’s intranet connection to the Internet. Employees might have used their employer’s laptop computers to connect to their own ISPs to download inappropriate Web content. For these situations, you need to consult your organization’s employee policy guidelines for what’s considered appropriate use of the organization’s digital resources.\n",
      "E-mail Abuse Investigations\n",
      "E-mail investigations typically include spam, inappropriate and offensive message content, and harassment or threats. E-mail is subject to the same restrictions as other computer evidence data, in that an organization must have a defined policy, as described previously. The following list is what you need for an investigation involving e-mail abuse:\n",
      "An electronic copy of the offending e-mail that contains message header data; consult with your e-mail server administrator\n",
      "If available, e-mail server log records; consult with your e-mail server administrator to see whether they are available\n",
      "For e-mail systems that store users’ messages on a central server, access to the server; consult with your e-mail server administrator\n",
      "For e-mail systems that store users’ messages on a computer as an Outlook .pst or .ost file, for example, access to the computer so that you can perform a forensic analysis on it\n",
      "Your preferred digital forensics analysis tool\n",
      "The following steps outline the recommended procedure for e-mail investigations:\n",

      "Attorney-Client Privilege Investigations\n",
      "When conducting a digital forensics analysis under attorney-client privilege (ACP) Communication between an attorney and client about legal matters is protected as confidential communications. The purpose of having confidential communications is to promote honest and open dialogue between an attorney and client. This confidential information must not be shared with unauthorized people. rules for an attorney, you must keep all findings confidential. The attorney you’re working for is the ultimate authority over the investigation. For investigations of this nature, attorneys typically request that you extract all data from drives. It’s your responsibility to comply with the attorney’s directions. Because of the large quantities of data a drive can contain, the attorney will want to know\n",
      "Because of the large quantities of data a drive can contain, the attorney will want to know about everything of interest on the drives.\n",
      "Many attorneys like to have printouts of the data you have recovered, but printouts can pose problems when you have log files with several thousand pages of data or CAD drawing programs that can be read only by proprietary programs. You need to persuade and educate many attorneys on how digital evidence can be viewed electronically. In addition, learn how to teach attorneys and paralegals to sort through files so that you can help them efficiently analyze the huge amount of data a forensic examination produces.\n",
      "You can also encounter problems if you find data in the form of binary files, such as CAD drawings. Examining these files requires using the CAD program that created them. In addition, engineering companies often have specialized drafting programs. Discovery demands for lawsuits involving a product that caused injury or death requires extracting design plans for attorneys and expert witnesses to review. You’re responsible for locating the programs for these design plans so that attorneys and expert witnesses can view the evidence files.\n",
      "The following list shows the basic steps for conducting an ACP case:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Request a memo from the attorney directing you to start the investigation. The memorandum must state that the investigation is privileged communication and list your name and any other associates’ names assigned to the case.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Request a list of keywords of interest to the investigation.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "After you have received the memorandum, initiate the investigation and analysis. Any findings you made before receiving the memorandum are subject to discovery by the opposing attorney.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "For drive examinations, make two bit-stream images (discussed later in this chapter) of the drive, using a different tool for each image. This approach is advisable because every tool has its strengths and weaknesses. If you have large enough storage drives, make each bit-stream image uncompressed (refer to Chapter 3) so that if it becomes corrupt, you can still examine uncorrupted areas with your preferred forensics analysis tool.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Verify the hash values on all files on the original and re-created disks or its image file.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Methodically examine every portion of the drive (both allocated and unallocated data areas) and extract all data.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Run keyword searches on allocated and unallocated disk space. Follow up the searches to determine whether the results contain information that supports the case.\n",
      "8.\n",
      "For Windows OSs, use specialty tools to analyze and extract data from the Registry, such as AccessData Registry Viewer or a Registry viewer program (discussed in more detail in Chapter 5). Use the Edit, Find menu option in Registry Editor, for example, to search for keywords of interest to the investigation.\n",
      "9.\n",
      "For binary files, such as CAD drawings, find the correct program and, if possible, make printouts of the binary file content. If the files are too large, load the specialty program on a separate workstation with the recovered binary files so that the attorney can view them.\n",
      "10.\n",
      "For unallocated data recovery, use a tool that removes or replaces nonprintable data.\n",
      "11.\n",
      "Consolidate all recovered data from the evidence bit-stream image into well-organized folders and subfolders. Store the recovered data output, using a logical and easy-to-follow storage method for the attorney or paralegal.\n",
      "Here are some other guidelines to remember for ACP cases:\n",
      "Minimize all written communication with the attorney; use the telephone when you need to ask questions or provide information related to the case.\n",
      "Any documentation written to the attorney must contain a header stating that it’s “Privileged Legal Communication—Confidential Work Product,” as defined under the attorney-work-product rule.\n",
      "Assist the attorney and paralegal in analyzing the data.\n",
      "If you have difficulty complying with the directions or don’t understand the directives in the memo, contact the attorney and explain the problem. Always keep an open line of verbal communication with the attorney during these types of investigations. If you’re communicating via e-mail, use encryption or another secure e-mail service for all messages.\n",
      "Industrial Espionage Investigations\n",
      "Industrial espionage cases can be time consuming and are subject to scope creep problems (meaning the investigation’s focus widens and becomes more time consuming). This section offers some guidelines on how to deal with industrial espionage investigations. Be aware that cases dealing with foreign nationals might be violations of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or Export Administration Regulations (EAR). For more information on ITAR, see the U.S. Department of State’s Web site (www.state.gov; substitute the actual state name or a shortened version for state) or do an Internet search for “International Traffic in Arms Regulations.” For EAR information, see the U.S. Department of Commerce Web site (www.doc.gov) or do an Internet search for “Export Administration\n",

      "Unlike the other private-sector investigations covered in this section, all suspected industrial espionage cases should be treated as criminal investigations. The techniques described here are for private network environments and internal investigations that haven’t yet been reported to law enforcement officials. Make sure you don’t become an agent of law enforcement by filing a complaint of a suspected espionage case before substantiating the allegation. The following list includes staff you might need when planning an industrial espionage investigation. This list isn’t exhaustive, so use your knowledge to improve on these recommendations:\n",
      "The digital investigator who’s responsible for disk forensic examinations\n",
      "The technology specialist who is knowledgeable about the suspected compromised technical data\n",
      "The network specialist who can perform log analysis and set up network monitors to trap network communication of possible suspects\n",
      "The threat assessment specialist (typically an attorney) who’s familiar with federal and state laws and regulations related to ITAR or EAR and industrial espionage\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "The International Competition Network has established guidelines (available at www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc627.pdf) for digital evidence gathering in private-sector settings; they’re used by more than 90 jurisdictions.\n",
      "In addition, consider the following guidelines when initiating an international espionage investigation:\n",
      "Determine whether this investigation involves a possible industrial espionage incident, and then determine whether it falls under ITAR or EAR.\n",
      "Consult with corporate attorneys and upper management if the investigations must be conducted discreetly.\n",
      "Determine what information is needed to substantiate the allegation of industrial espionage.\n",
      "Generate a list of keywords for disk forensics and network monitoring.\n",
      "List and collect resources needed for the investigation.\n",
      "Determine the goal and scope of the investigation; consult with management and the company’s attorneys on how much work you should do.\n",
      "Initiate the investigation after approval from management, and make regular reports of your activities and findings.\n",
      "The following are planning considerations for industrial espionage investigations:\n",
      "Examine all e-mail of suspected employees, both company-provided e-mail and free Web-based services.\n",
      "Search Internet forums or blogs for any postings related to the incident.\n",
      "Initiate physical surveillance with cameras on people or things of interest to the investigation.\n",
      "If available, examine all facility physical access logs for sensitive areas, which might include secure areas where smart badges or video surveillance recordings are used.\n",
      "If there’s a suspect, determine his or her location in relation to the vulnerable resource that was compromised.\n",
      "Study the suspect’s work habits.\n",
      "Collect all incoming and outgoing phone logs to see whether any unique or unusual places were called.\n",
      "When conducting an industrial espionage case, follow these basic steps:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Gather all personnel assigned to the investigation and brief them on the plan and any concerns.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Gather the resources needed to conduct the investigation.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Start the investigation by placing surveillance systems, such as cameras and network monitors, at key locations.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Discreetly gather any additional evidence, such as the suspect’s computer drive, and make a bit-stream image for follow-up examination.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Collect all log data from networks and e-mail servers, and examine them for unique items that might relate to the investigation.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Report regularly to management and corporate attorneys on your investigation’s status and current findings.\n",
      "7.\n",
      "Review the investigation’s scope with management and corporate attorneys to determine whether it needs to be expanded and more resources added.\n",
      "Interviews and Interrogations in High-Tech Investigations\n",
      "Becoming a skilled interviewer and interrogator can take many years of experience. Typically, a private-sector digital investigator is a technical person acquiring the evidence for an investigation. Many large organizations have full-time security investigators with years of training and experience in criminal and civil investigations and interviewing techniques. Few of these investigators have any computing or network technical skills, so you might be asked to assist in interviewing or interrogating a suspect when you have performed a forensic disk analysis on that suspect’s machine.\n",
      "An interrogation is different from an interview. An interview A conversation conducted to collect information from a witness or suspect about specific facts related to an investigation. is usually conducted to collect information from a witness or suspect about specific facts related to an investigation. An interrogation The process of trying to get a suspect to confess to a specific incident or crime. is the process of trying to get a suspect to confess to a specific incident or crime. An investigator might change from an interview to an interrogation when talking to a witness or suspect. The more experience and training investigators have in the art of interviewing and interrogating, the more easily they can determine whether a witness is credible and possibly a suspect.\n",
      "Your role as a digital investigator is to instruct the investigator conducting the interview on what questions to ask and what the answers should be. As you build rapport with the investigator, he or she might ask you to question the suspect. Watching a skilled interrogator is a learning experience in human relations skills. If you’re asked to assist in an interview or interrogation, prepare yourself by answering the following questions:\n",
      "What questions do I need to ask the suspect to get the vital information about the case?\n",
      "Do I know what I’m talking about, or will I have to research the topic or technology related to the investigation?\n",
      "Do I need additional questions to cover other indirect issues related to the investigation?\n",
      "Common interview and interrogation errors include being unprepared for the interview or interrogation and not having the right questions or enough questions to increase your depth of knowledge. Make sure you don’t run out of conversation topics; you need to keep the conversation friendly to gain the suspect’s confidence. Avoid doubting your own skills, which might show the suspect you lack confidence in your ability. The ingredients for a successful interview or interrogation include the following:\n",
      "Being patient throughout the session\n",
      "Repeating or rephrasing questions to zero in on specific facts from a reluctant witness or suspect\n",
      "Being tenacious\n",
      "Understanding Data Recovery Workstations and Software\n",
      "Now you know what’s involved in acquiring and documenting evidence. In Chapter 2, you examine a complete setup of a digital forensics lab, which is where you conduct your investigations and where most of your equipment and software are located, including secure evidence containers. Be aware that some companies that perform digital investigations also do data recovery, e-discovery, and other related investigations.\n",
      "Remember the difference between data recovery and digital forensics. In data recovery, typically, the customer or your company just wants the data back. The other key difference is that in data recovery, you usually know what you’re trying to retrieve. In digital forensics, you might have an idea of what you’re searching for, but not necessarily.\n",
      "To conduct your investigation and analysis, you must have a specially configured PC known as a forensic workstation A workstation set up to allow copying forensic evidence, whether it’s on a hard drive, flash drive, or the cloud. It usually has software preloaded and ready to use. , which is a computer loaded with additional bays and forensics software. Depending on your needs, a forensic workstation can use the following operating systems:\n",
      "MS-DOS 6.22\n",
      "Windows 95, 98, or Me\n",
      "Windows NT 3.5 or 4.0\n",
      "Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, or 10\n",
      "Linux\n",
      "Mac OS X and macOS\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "Chapters 2 and 6 cover the software resources you need and the forensics lab and workstation in detail. Visit www.digitalintelligence.com to examine the specifications of the Forensic Recovery of Evidence Device (F.R.E.D.) unit or www.forensiccomputers.com to look at current products.\n",
      "If you start any operating system while you’re examining a hard disk, the OS alters the evidence disk by writing data to the Recycle Bin and corrupts the quality and integrity of the evidence you’re trying to preserve. Chapter 5 covers which files Windows updates automatically at startup. Newer Windows OSs also record the serial numbers of hard drives and CPUs in a file, which can be difficult to recover.\n",
      "Of all the Microsoft OSs, the least intrusive (in terms of changing data) to disks is MS-DOS 6.22. With the continued evolution of Microsoft OSs, it’s not always practical to use older MS-DOS platforms, however. Many older digital forensics acquisition tools work in the MS-DOS environment. These tools can operate from an MS-DOS window in Windows 98 or from the command prompt in Windows 2000 and later. Some of their functions are disabled or generate error messages when run in these OSs, however.\n",
      "Newer file system formats, such as NTFS, are accessible—that is, readable—only from Windows NT and later or any Linux OS. You can use one of several write-blockers that enable you to boot to Windows without writing data to the evidence drive. In Chapter 3, you learn more about write-blockers and some inexpensive alternatives for preserving data during an acquisition.\n",
      "Many hardware write-blockers that connect to USB or FireWire ports are on the market. Several vendors sell write-blockers, including Digital Intelligence Ultra-Kit, UltraBlock, FireFly, FireChief 800, and USB Write Blocker; WiebeTECH Forensic DriveDock; Guidance Software FastBloc; Paralan’s SCSI Write Blockers; Tableu UltraBlock SAS Write Blocker; and Intelligent Computer Solutions (www.ics-iq.com) Image LinkMASSter Forensics Hard Case.\n",
      "Software write-blockers are available, too. Typically, these write-blockers require a bootable DVD or USB drive that runs an independent OS in a suspect computer’s RAM. For more information on software write-blockers, see http://forensicsoft.com. Windows products are being developed that make performing disk forensics easier. However, because Windows has limitations in performing disk forensics, you need to develop skills in acquiring data with Linux. In later chapters, you learn more about using these other tools. Keep in mind that no single digital forensics tool can recover everything. Each tool and OS has its own strengths and weaknesses, so develop skills with as many tools as possible to become an effective digital investigator. Appendix D has additional information on how to use\n",

      "Setting Up Your Workstation for Digital Forensics\n",
      "With current digital forensics hardware and software, configuring a computer workstation or laptop as a forensic workstation is simple. All that’s required are the following:\n",
      "A workstation running Windows 7 or later\n",
      "A write-blocker device\n",
      "Digital forensics acquisition tool\n",
      "Digital forensics analysis tool\n",
      "A target drive to receive the source or suspect disk data\n",
      "Spare PATA and SATA ports\n",

      "Other specialized viewing tools\n",
      "In Chapter 2, you learn more about setting up and configuring a computer to be a forensic workstation.\n",
      "Conducting an Investigation\n",
      "Now you’re ready to return to the Montgomery_72018 case. You have created a plan for the investigation, set up your forensic workstation, and installed the necessary forensics analysis software you need to examine the evidence. The type of software to install includes your preferred analysis tool, such as OSForensics, Forensic Explorer, EnCase, FTK, or X-Ways Forensics; an office suite, such as LibreOffice; and a graphics viewer, such as IrfanView. To begin conducting an investigation, you start by copying the evidence, using a variety of methods. No single method retrieves all data from a disk, so using several tools to retrieve and analyze data is a good idea. Start by gathering the resources you identified in your investigation plan. You need the following items:\n",
      "Original storage media\n",
      "Evidence custody form\n",
      "Evidence container for the storage media, such as an evidence bag\n",
      "Bit-stream imaging tool; in this case, FTK Imager Lite\n",
      "Forensic workstation to copy and examine the evidence\n",
      "Secure evidence locker, cabinet, or safe\n",
      "Gathering the Evidence\n",
      "Now you’re ready to gather evidence for the Montgomery_72018 case. Remember that you need antistatic bags and pads with wrist straps to prevent static electricity from damaging digital evidence. To acquire George Montgomery’s storage media from the IT Department and then secure the evidence, you perform the following steps:\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Arrange to meet the IT manager to interview him and pick up the storage media.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "After interviewing the IT manager, fill out the evidence form, have him sign it, and then sign it yourself.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Store the storage media in an evidence bag, and then transport it to your forensic facility.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "Carry the evidence to a secure container, such as a locker, cabinet, or safe.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "Complete the evidence custody form. As mentioned, if you’re using a multi-evidence form, you can store the form in the file folder for the case. If you’re also using single-evidence forms, store them in the secure container with the evidence. Reduce the risk of tampering by limiting access to the forms.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "Secure the evidence by locking the container.\n",
      "Understanding Bit-stream Copies\n",
      "A bit-stream copy A bit-by-bit duplicate of data on the original storage medium. This process is usually called “acquiring an image,” “making an image,” or “forensic copy.” is a bit-by-bit copy (also known as a “forensic copy”) of the original drive or storage medium and is an exact duplicate. The more exact the copy, the better chance you have of retrieving the evidence you need from the disk. This process is usually referred to as “acquiring an image” or “making an image” of a suspect drive. A bit-stream copy is different from a simple backup copy of a disk. Backup software can copy or compress only files that are stored in a folder or are of a known file type. Backup software can’t copy deleted files and e-mails or recover file fragments.\n",
      "A bit-stream image The file where the bitstream copy is stored; usually referred to as an “image,” “image save,” or “image file.” is the file containing the bit-stream copy of all data on a disk or disk partition. For simplicity, it’s usually referred to as an “image,” “image save,” or “image file.” To create an exact image of an evidence disk, copying the image to a target disk that’s identical to the evidence disk is preferable (Figure 1-11). The target disk’s manufacturer and model, in general, should be the same as the original disk’s manufacturer and model. If the target disk is identical to the original, the size in bytes and sectors of both disks should also be the same. Some image acquisition tools can accommodate a target disk that’s a different size than the original. These\n",
      "acquisition tools can accommodate a target disk that’s a different size than the original. These imaging tools are discussed in Chapter 3. Older digital forensics tools designed for MS-DOS work only on a copied disk. Current GUI tools can work on both a disk drive and copied data sets that many manufacturers refer to as “image saves.”\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "Occasionally, the track and sector maps on the original and target disks don’t match, even if you use disks of exactly the same size that are different makes or models. Tools such as Guidance EnCase and NTI SafeBack adjust for the target drive’s geometry. One other tool, X-Ways WinHex Specialist Edition, can copy sector by sector to equal-size or larger disks without needing to force changes in the target disk’s geometry.\n",
      "Acquiring an Image of Evidence Media\n",
      "After you retrieve and secure the evidence, you’re ready to copy the evidence media and analyze the data. The first rule of digital forensics is to preserve the original evidence. Then conduct your analysis only on a copy of the data—the image of the original medium. Several vendors offer Windows and Linux acquisition tools. These tools, however, require a write-blocking device (discussed in Chapter 3) when acquiring data from disks and USB drives; you also learn about acquiring forensic images in this chapter.\n",
      "Analyzing Your Digital Evidence\n",
      "When you analyze digital evidence, your job is to recover the data. If users have deleted or overwritten files on a disk, the disk contains deleted files and file fragments in addition to existing files. Remember that as files are deleted, the space they occupied becomes free space—meaning it can be used for new files that are saved or files that expand as data is added to them. The files that were deleted are still on the disk until a new file is saved to the same physical location, overwriting the original file. In the meantime, those files can still be retrieved. Forensics tools such as Autopsy can retrieve deleted files for use as evidence.\n",

      "The next step is analyzing the data and searching for information related to the complaint. Data analysis can be the most time-consuming task, even when you know exactly what to look for in the evidence. The method for locating evidentiary artifacts is to search for specific known data values. Data values can be unique words or nonprintable characters, such as hexadecimal codes. There are also printable character codes that can’t be generated from a keyboard, such as the copyright (©) or registered trademark (™) symbols. Many digital forensics programs can search for character strings (letters and numbers) and hexadecimal values, such as 0xA9 for the copyright symbol or 0xAE for the registered trademark symbol. All these searchable data values are referred to as “keywords.”\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Hexadecimal values are typically preceded with a zero and the letter x to clearly identify what they represent.\n",

      "Completing the Case\n",
      "After analyzing the disk, you can retrieve deleted files, e-mail, and items that have been purposefully hidden, which you do in Chapters 8, 9, and 11. The files on George’s USB drive indicate that he was conducting a side business on his company computer. Now that you have retrieved and analyzed the evidence, you need to find the answers to the following questions to write the final report:\n",
      "How did George’s manager acquire the disk?\n",
      "Did George perform the work on a laptop, which is his own property? If so, did he conduct business transactions on his break or during his lunch hour?\n",
      "At what times of the day was George using the non-work-related files? How did you retrieve this information?\n",
      "Which company policies apply?\n",
      "Are there any other items that need to be considered?\n",
      "When you write your report, state what you did and what you found. The report you generate with a forensics tool gives an account of the steps you took. As part of your final report, depending on guidance from management or legal counsel, include this report file to document your work. In any digital investigation, you should be able to repeat the steps you took and produce the same results. This capability is referred to as repeatable findings Being able to obtain the same results every time from a digital forensics examination. ; without it, your work product has no value as evidence.\n",
      "In addition to writing a report, keep a written journal of everything you do. Your notes can be used in court, so be mindful of what you write or e-mail, even to a fellow investigator. Often these journals start out as handwritten notes, but you can transcribe them to electronic format periodically.\n",
      "Basic report writing involves answering the six Ws: who, what, when, where, why, and how. In addition to these basic facts, you must also explain computer and network processes. Typically, your reader is a senior personnel manager, a lawyer, or occasionally a judge who might have little computer knowledge. Identify your reader and write the report for that person. Provide explanations for processes and how systems and their components work.\n",
      "Your organization might have templates to use when writing reports. Depending on your organization’s needs and requirements, your report must describe the findings from your analysis. The reports generated by forensics tools generally list your examination and data recovery findings. Some digital forensics tools also generate a log file of all actions taken during your examination and analysis. Integrating a log file from these other tools can enhance your final report. When describing the findings, consider writing your narrative first and then placing the log file at the end of the report, with references to it in the main narrative. Chapter 14 covers writing final reports for investigations in more detail.\n",
      "In the Montgomery_72018 case, you want to show what evidence exists proving that George had his own business registering domain names. You should include a list of his clients’ names, his income from this business, and any correspondence he wrote to clients about their accounts. The time and date stamps on the files are during work hours, so you should include this information, too. Eventually, you hand the evidence file to your supervisor or to Steve, George’s manager, who then decides on a course of action.\n",
      "Autopsy’s Report Generator\n",
      "Autopsy has several styles of reports, including a plain text file, an HTML Web page with links to artifacts, and an Excel spreadsheet. To generate a report, you can follow this general procedure:\n",

      "After the report is generated, Autopsy displays the Report Generation Progress window. Click the link to open the report, and then click Close after you’ve reviewed it.\n",
      "Critiquing the Case\n",
      "After you close the case and make your final report, you need to meet with your department or a group of fellow investigators and critique the case in an effort to improve your work. Ask yourself assessment questions such as the following:\n",
      "How could you improve your performance in the case?\n",
      "Did you expect the results you found? Did the case develop in ways you did not expect?\n",

      "Chapter Summary\n",
      "Digital forensics applies forensics procedures to digital evidence. This process involves systematically accumulating and analyzing digital information for use as evidence in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. Digital forensics differs from network forensics and data recovery in scope, technique, and objective.\n",
      "Laws relating to digital evidence were established in the 1970s.\n",
      "To be a successful digital forensics investigator, you must be familiar with more than one computing platform. To supplement your knowledge, develop and maintain contact with computer, network, and investigative professionals.\n",
      "Investigators need specialized workstations to examine digital evidence, including additional bays for evidence drives, forensics software, and write blockers.\n",
      "Public-sector and private-sector investigations differ, in that public-sector investigations typically require a search warrant before seizing digital evidence. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and similar legislation in other countries apply to government search and seizure. During public-sector investigations, you search for evidence to support criminal allegations. During private-sector investigations, you search for evidence to support allegations of policy violations, abuse of assets, and, in some cases, criminal complaints.\n",
      "Warning banners should be used to remind employees and visitors of company policy on computer, e-mail, and Internet use.\n",
      "Companies should define and limit the number of authorized requesters who can start an investigation.\n",
      "Digital forensics investigators must maintain professional conduct to protect their credibility.\n",
      "Always use a systematic approach to your investigations. Follow the checklist in this chapter as a guideline for your case.\n",
      "When planning a case, take into account the nature of the case, instructions from the requester, what additional tools and expertise you might need, and how you will acquire the evidence.\n",
      "Criminal cases and company-policy violations should be handled in much the same manner to ensure that quality evidence is presented. Both criminal cases and company-policy violations can go to court.\n",
      "When you begin a case, there might be unanticipated challenges that weren’t obvious when applying a systematic approach to your investigation plan. For all investigations, you need to plan for contingencies for any unexpected problems you might encounter.\n",
      "You should create a standard evidence custody form to track the chain of custody of evidence for your case. There are two types of forms: a multi-evidence form and a single-evidence form.\n",
      "Internet abuse investigations require examining server log data.\n",
      "For attorney-client privilege cases, all written communication should have a header label stating that it’s privileged communication and a confidential work product.\n",
      "A bit-stream copy is a bit-by-bit duplicate of the original disk. You should use the duplicate, whenever possible, when analyzing evidence.\n",
      "Always maintain a journal to keep notes on exactly what you did when handling evidence.\n",
      "You should always critique your own work to determine what improvements you made during each case, what could have been done differently, and how to apply those lessons to future cases.\n",
      "Key Terms\n",
      "affidavitA notarized document, given under penalty of perjury, that investigators create to detail their findings. This document is often used to justify issuing a warrant or to deal with abuse in a corporation. Also called a “declaration” when the document isn’t notarized.\n",

      "Explain Autopsy’s features that help forensics investigators recover digital evidence\n",
      "Investigating digital evidence takes time because of the large storage capacity of current hard disk drives. In addition, operating systems (OSs) and applications are typically large collections of files and executable programs that work together to form a user interface. Autopsy for Windows combines an extensive array of digital forensics tools into a single stand-alone software suite. It enables investigators to analyze storage devices; search for files, folders, e-mails, documents, pictures, and any remaining evidence that might have been deleted; and document their findings.\n",
      "Forensics investigators need to search large volumes of data stored on different types of storage media, such as CDs and DVDs, USB drives, and hard disk drives, for potential digital evidence. In many criminal cases, the suspect might have attempted to delete a file or modify it in some way to prevent other users from seeing it. Autopsy can recover deleted or corrupted files and display the contents. Additional features, such as keyword searching, enable investigators to search for words related to the crime or number patterns that might reveal phone or credit card numbers. Autopsy also creates hash values for every file so that investigators can search for known file types, changed or altered files, malware, and legitimate application and OS files. File hashes are mathematically derived\n",
      "files, malware, and legitimate application and OS files. File hashes are mathematically derived hexadecimal values that uniquely identify both known and unknown files. Hashing is an important feature because it preserves the chain of custody by making sure files haven’t been altered or changed and recovered evidence doesn’t change over time. Autopsy also enables you to import hash sets so that you can identify known files. One widely used hash set is the National Software Resource Library (NSRL), which contains known OS hash values. In this lab, you install Autopsy for Windows to begin investigating digital evidence.\n",

      "Explain the purpose of using an imaging tool to copy digital evidence\n",
      "Forensics investigators must protect the integrity of digital evidence from the time it’s seized until the end of the trial. This task, known as “maintaining the chain of custody,” ensures that the original data hasn’t been changed during the investigation. They duplicate digital evidence by using a bit-stream process called “imaging,” which preserves the original evidence along with other system files and duplicates a storage device with files intact to another lab storage device.\n",
      "Imaging makes it possible to examine the duplicated storage device without the risk of damaging potential evidence. This bit-stream process makes an exact byte-for-byte copy of the original storage device that preserves the physical and logical file locations and any unpartitioned space. This process is important because remnants of deleted files still exist on a storage device until they’re overwritten during computer operations. These file remnants can be searched and repaired to recover deleted files and make them readable. Imaging also generates file hashes that can be used to identify potential evidence and validate its integrity throughout the investigation process.\n",
      "FTK Imager Lite is a compact version of AccessData’s commercial tool FTK Imager. It’s designed to be run from most small storage devices, such as a small USB drive, or on any Windows computer. It can preview digital files to determine whether evidentiary data exists before starting an extensive investigation. If potential forensic data is found, FTK Imager Lite can then forensically duplicate the storage device to process the data safely. It supports the following file systems: Microsoft FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS; Linux/UNIX Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, and ReiserFS3; macOS Apple File System (AFS), HFS, and HFS+; and CDFS and VxFS (used for CDs and DVDs).

      "2.\n",
      "When you want to begin a new digital evidence analysis, you click the Create New Case button. Doing so starts the New Case Information Wizard, where you enter information about the case. Figure 1-6 shows the Select Data Source window.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Clicking the Open Recent Case button displays up to five previous cases. You can select one and click Open to load the case into Autopsy. Clicking the Open Existing Case button enables you to navigate to the folder containing a previous case that isn’t listed in the Open Recent Case window. All Autopsy case files have an .aut extension, as shown in Figure 1-7.\n",
      "4.\n",
      "After you create or load a case into Autopsy, you see the main window, which is divided into three parts. The vertical pane on the left is the Tree Viewer. On the right, the upper pane is the Result Viewer, and the lower pane is the Content Viewer.\n",
      "5.\n",
      "To expand or collapse items in the Tree Viewer, click the + or - symbol next to an item. Expanding a folder or drive displays its contents in the Result Viewer pane. To view a file’s contents, click its filename in the Result Viewer pane, and the Content Viewer pane displays the contents (see Figure 1-8). After you add digital evidence to a case, Autopsy automatically analyzes and catalogs files into different file types, such as photos in the Images folder or Microsoft Word files in the Documents folder. The files listed under the Views, Results, and Tags items are quick reference links to the same data shown under the Data Sources item. The Reports item stores links to all reports you have generated.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "The Result Viewer pane has a Table tab and a Thumbnail tab. The Table tab lists filenames in the folder you selected in the Tree Viewer. The Thumbnail tab displays thumbnail pictures of files. Clicking a thumbnail displays the full-size image in the Content Viewer (see Figure 1-9).\n",
      "7.\n",
      "The Content Viewer pane shows the contents of a file selected in the Result Viewer pane. You can view the data in different forms by clicking the Hex, String, File Metadata, Results, Indexed Text, and Media tabs (see Figure 1-10). In this example, the Results and Indexed Text tabs are grayed out, which indicates no data result or index data is available for this file.\n",
      "8.\n",
      "The menu bar at the top of Autopsy’s main window has many additional options. The two most common are Case and Tools. The first three options in the Case menu are identical to the buttons in the Welcome window. Additional options are Add Digital Evidence, View Case Properties, Close, and Exit Autopsy. The Tools menu has analysis options, such as Run Ingest Modules for performing specialized tasks, such as e-mail parsing and photo carving. Output from these tasks is saved under the Tree Viewer’s Results item.\n",
      "9.\n",
      "Immediately below the menu bar is a useful quick link bar for menu options you use more often. For example, the Ingest Messages icon shown in Figure 1-8 can be used to view a log of Autopsy’s activities (see Figure 1-11).\n",
      "10.\n",
      "The quick link bar also has the Keyword Lists and Keyword Search options. As shown in Figure 1-12, the Keyword Lists feature has additional parameters, such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and credit cards.
