      "After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able to:\n",
      "Describe the field of digital forensics\n",
      "Explain how to prepare for computer investigations and summarize the difference between public-sector and private-sector investigations\n",
      "Explain the importance of maintaining professional conduct\n",
      "Describe how to prepare a digital forensics investigation by taking a systematic approach\n",
      "Describe procedures for private-sector digital investigations\n",
      "Explain requirements for data recovery workstations and software\n",
      "Summarize how to conduct an investigation, including critiquing a case\n",
      "In the past several years, the field of computer forensics has developed significantly, including new terminology. This chapter introduces you to computer forensics or, as it’s now typically called, digital forensics and discusses issues of importance in the industry. This book blends traditional investigative methods with classic systems analysis problem-solving techniques and applies them to investigations involving computers and other digital media and systems. Understanding these disciplines combined with the use of the forensics tools will make you a skilled digital forensics examiner.\n",
      "This chapter also gives you an overview of how to manage a digital investigation and use standard problem-solving techniques. You learn about the problems and challenges forensics examiners face when preparing and processing investigations, including the ideas and questions they must consider. To perform the activities and projects in this chapter, you work with forensic disk images from small USB drives and then can apply the same techniques to a large disk.\n",
