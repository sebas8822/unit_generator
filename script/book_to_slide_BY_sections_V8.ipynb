      "Appendixes\n",
      "Each section should have a title indicating what you’re discussing, so make sure it conveys the essential point of the section. For example, the body of your report might be titled “Investigation Findings for Superior Bicycles, Inc.: Intellectual Property Theft.”\n",
      "If the report is long and complex, you should include an abstract. Typically, more people read the abstract than the entire report, so writing one for your report is important. The abstract and table of contents give readers an overview of the report and its points so that they can decide what parts they need to review. An abstract simply condenses the report’s key points to focus on the essential information. It should be one or two paragraphs totaling about 150 to 200 words. Remember that the abstract should describe the examination or investigation and present the report’s main ideas in a summarized form. Informative abstracts don’t duplicate references or tables of results. As with any research paper, write the abstract last.\n",
      "The body consists of the introduction and discussion sections. The introduction should state the report’s purpose (the questions to be answered) and show that you’re aware of its terms of reference. You should also state any methods used and any limitations and indicate how the report is structured. It’s important to justify why you’re writing the report, so make sure you answer the question “What is the problem?” You should also give readers a map of what you’re delivering. Introduce the problem, moving from broader issues to the specific problem, finishing the introduction with the precise aims of the report (key questions). Craft this introduction carefully, setting up the processes you used to develop the information in logical order. Refer to relevant facts, ideas, and theories as\n",
      "used to develop the information in logical order. Refer to relevant facts, ideas, and theories as well as related research by other authors. Organize discussion sections logically under headings to reflect how you classify information and to ensure that your information remains relevant to the investigation.\n",
      "Two other main sections are the conclusion and supporting materials (references and appendixes). The conclusion starts by referring to the report’s purpose, states the main points, draws conclusions, and possibly renders an opinion. References and appendixes list the supporting material to which your work refers. Follow a style manual’s guidelines on format for presenting references, such as Gregg Reference Manual: A Manual of Style, Grammar, Usage, and Formatting; The Chicago Manual of Style: The Essential Guide for Writers, Editors, and Publishers; or MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing from the Modern Language Association. Appendixes provide additional resource material not included in the body of the report.\n",

      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publishes articles, provides tools, and creates procedures for testing and validating computer forensics software. Software should be verified to improve evidence admissibility in judicial proceedings. NIST sponsors the CFTT project to manage research on forensics tools. For additional information on this testing project, visit www.cftt.nist.gov . The Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets (CFReDS; www.cfreds.nist.gov ) has been created recently to provide data sets for tools, training, and hardware testing.\n",
      "NIST also created criteria for testing forensics tools, which are included in the article “General Test Methodology for Computer Forensic Tools” (version 1.9, November 7, 2001), available at www.cftt.nist.gov/testdocs.html . This article addresses the lack of specifications for what forensics tools should do and the importance of tools meeting judicial scrutiny. The criteria are based on standard testing methods and ISO 17025 criteria for testing when no current standards are available. Your lab must meet the following criteria and keep accurate records so that when new software and hardware become available, testing standards are in place for your lab:\n",

      "NIST has also developed several tools for evaluating drive-imaging tools. These tools are posted on the CFTT Web site at www.cftt.nist.gov/disk_imaging.htm .\n",
      "In addition, NIST created the NSRL project ( www.nsrl.nist.gov ) with the goal of collecting all known hash values for commercial software and OS files. The primary hash NSRL uses is SHA-1, which generates known digital signatures called the Reference Data Set (RDS). SHA-1 has better accuracy than other hashing methods, such as MD5. The purpose of collecting known hash values is to reduce the number of known files, such as OS or program files, included in a forensics examination of a drive so that only unknown files are left. You can also use the RDS to locate and identify known bad files, such as illegal images and malware, on a suspect drive.\n",
